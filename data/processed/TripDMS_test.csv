1,0,2,-1,2,-1,2,-1,"great potential , unrealized i too arrive at the sofitel with high expectation .the website photo look great and the staff have respond to all of my email request quickly and graciously .travel with friend , we book a superior room at a rate of 185e and a executive suite at a rate of 295e .for a four night stay.i arrive around 10am , please to discover the hotel be honor my request for a early check-in .the process be quick , the staff very friendly .unfortunately , my happiness level decrease when i see my suite .i be locate on the 6th floor overlook dam square .decorate as you see in the web photo with blonde and dark wood , the tiny living area be about 7-8 foot with a small sofa , chair , desk and build in cabinet with a expresso maker , minibar and tv .the promise cd player be miss .there be a small doorway to the bedroom just barely hold a king-sized bed with another small doorway to a bathroom .very small , almost like regular room but cut into two compartment .i call the front desk and comment that the suite seem very different from the one show on the website which contain a table and chair .i be tell that i would be give one of the largest suite .this , i learn later , be not true .the second room be not ready until later in the day .we appreciate that the staff have provide a room right across the hall from the suite , face the back of the hotel .it be a tad dark but otherwise fine with the same blonde/dark wood decor .the bathroom be spacious with a very large bathtub and very clean .it closely resemble the website photo.the hotel be located on dam square across from the royal palace and just a few block from central station , the center of tourist mecca .the grand krasnapolsky be across the square and the hotel amsterdam be next door .the tram stop right in front of the hotel with additional stop for other route very close by .this make the hotel very convenient .you can hop on a tram or you can walk to you destination .we walk everywhere , have a fun dinner and walk back to the hotel with no problems.the suite be claustrophobic to sleep in and the noise of dam square make it impossible to keep the window open .the tram bell prove to be the greatest challenge .a housekeeper show we a junior suite the next morning and , at we request , the hotel allow we to move into it , generously lower we rate to 225e .a vast improvement over the suite .the junior suite be about the same size but without the wall that create the separate living area .the bathroom wall be make of glass , which add to the feel of spaciousness .the junior suite be larger than the superior room and not as dark .bottom line : skip the executive suite and get a junior suite .request the 07 suite ..room 207-507 .they be the best with a tiny set of stair into a room with a beam ceiling .we do not land one of these junior suite but the housekeeper recommend they .they also recommend the suite on the opposite corner of the building .i think they be room 217-517 but i may be off .apparently these be junior suite as well the larger one bedroom suite .they also have a tiny set of stair into the room and come with tiny balcony overlook dam square .if you book with swissotel , email the hotel and request these corner rooms.breakfast come with we rate but we only eat in the hotel a couple of time .the breakfast be good , with a variety of bread , pastry , cereal , cheese , smoked fish , egg , bacon , sausage , coffee and fresh juice .but there be so many other place you can go and if breakfast be not include , you have to pay 20e which be too much in comparison with all of the nearby cafe .i be also a bit outraged that the hotel charge my friend 20e for the ` breakfast ' on the morning of we arrival when all she have be a cup of coffee and roll while she wait for I to put my thing into my suite .other observation : the room have ac but it do not always work very well .you can not leave you window open because of the noise so the room can get a bit stuffy .the decor be very pleasant and contemporary , definitely a step above many of the other hotel in the area , but even recently renovate room have a bit of a ` worn ' feel .the beautiful wood floor of the junior suite be badly stain in one area , truly a shame .the housekeeping staff be top knotch .the room be very clean and the bathroom be spotless .the staff overall be very accommodate although one person leave we cold .the internet access offer from the room be spotty .i could not get it to work and could not get someone from the staff to help I .i have to resort to the business center computer .also , the crowd of tourist during the day wear you down quickly and the street toward central station be a bit seedy at night .i think it be because the hotel be very close to the red light district .the hotel have great potential .you really want to like it with its upscale room decor ..central location ..pleasant staff ..and clean enormous bathroom .hotel often grow on I after i get past the biasness of my expectation .unfortunately , this one do not .i doubt i will stay there again .after walk around amsterdam , i think i will sacrifice the ` great location ' on dam square for the charm of the canal and more ` residential ' area .i be more likely to stay at a place like the ambassade for less money , more charm and a bit of quiet ."

business trip , so i should have a moderately good understanding what be a 4 or 5 star hotel .the bali hilton in my opinion be not a 4 or 5 star hotel , in fact i would rate it 3 or 3 plus at best .the principal reason for this rating be : a overall lack of service , as a guest i feel that i be a type of commodity rather than a value customer , hotel staff while not rude be not in my opinion concern with provide service to I or see if everything be acceptable to me.the lack of variety of quality foodthe lack of romantic aura of the hotela feeling that i really do not get value for my money after visit other hotel in nusa dua that charge similar prices.i have detail below my principal issue as to why this be not a 4 or 5 star hotel below .i would strongly advise anyone against honeymoon at the bali hilton if you be expect to pay for a romantic holiday or alternatively be look for a value for money holiday .my poor opinion of the bali hilton be reinforce when we start frequent other nusa dua hotel for dinner in order to get a impression of the range of quality hotel accomodation and service available .base on we assessment of the hotel in the eastern nusa dua area i personally would only stay at the sheraton lagoona if i want a romantic holiday.my issue with my stay at the bali hiltonthe massive entrance and lobby that contain two bar be a pure facade , the two bar be rarely use by large number of guest , in the evening there be a singer at one of the bar but no one be ever there to really listen and the quality of the entertainment could be questioned.the hotel look to be age rapidly , both in structure and vegatation -lrb- i believe it be build in the late eigty or early ninety -rrb- and be in need of serio renovation .the vegatation and tropical plant in place appear to be on they last leg and the gardening be shabby in a lot of place particularly when compare to other nusa dua hotel such as the nusa dua beach hotel and the sheraton lagoona .the lift in we grande room block be not modern and regularly be out of service during we stay , which when you be on the 5th floor can be kind of annoying.do not get a ocean view room it be not worth the additional expense as you will not be on a beach front look out onto the sea but will be look at the sea from a tight angle and from a distance of several hundred metres.the reception area be understaffed and the staff or assistant manager seem incapable of multi-tasking so guest be often wait to be serve while the assistant manager sit around .this happen to I on a number of occasion where i be wait 10-15 minute to be served.the pool be ok in my opinion and the beach be probably larger in both width and length than most of the other hotel but be steeply inclined and it be about a 30 second walk from the sunbathe area to the water edge .note there be no sun lounger on the beach so you be not close to the water 's edge i.e. 5-10 metre away.the hotel have a massive green lagoon area around which most of the restaurant be situate , which appear to be a kind of nature area .however , certain area i.e. the north-west corner of the lagoon start to smell strongly of sewage during the evening .i do mention this to the management.the hotel gym-workout facility be not own by the hotel and therefore be not free of charge , you be require to pay usd 4 for a day pass to use the gym facilities.issues with we room include the shower need to be run for 5-7 minute prior to the hot water come through which seem hypocritical consider the hotel 's reccomendation that guest try to save water .obviously the quality of every room may not be the same as ours .the balcony table wobble so badly it be difficult to eat room service on it while not a major issue it be sometimes inconvenient .the tv reception quality be poor for the majority of satellite channel , i do mention this to management while i be there.the hotel do not in my opinion openly market the menu and location of its restaurant , it be not until the third week of we stay that we find out where the meditteranean and pub bar were.at the towel area you be require to sign for towel and put you room number , however when you return the towel nothing be request of you .why not a real be , why this process be necessary except for statistically gather the datum of how many towel each room use i do not know.in my opinion one of the main issue with the hotel be that it have no real open air restaurant , ok the waterfall and the indonesian restaurant be open air but they be not really romantic in my opinion .for example at the sheraton lagoona you can have have a romantic evening meal by the beach or in one of they special romantic canopy hut , this be not possible at the bali hilton.the menu of the pool bar be limit , and tend to have a lot of deep fried item , i do not think that the food have a kind of care about it that would make you think it be high quality .about 10-15 % of the time the staff would bring I the a drink i do not order but more importantly they do not check guest requirement that often , for example in my opinion at the pool the staff would walk around check guest may be once a hour and generally it be quicker to go to the bar and order.breakfast be kind of a third us/uk , a third continental european and a third asian .in my experience the breakfast hostess be not that friendly .the strength of the tea serve at breakfast be poor as it turn a grey-cream colour when you add milk .i suggest to the manager that they put the tea bags on the table for guest to choose and have the waiter serve boiling water ."

2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2,"have to be the best hotel value in l.a. !i book this hotel base on the many good review i read here on trip advisor .this be my last night in this hotel and i could not be happier with the choice .i do not usually travel alone , and though a new york city native , i do have some trepidation about stay alone in a hotel in l.a.i agree with all of the reviewer who mention the excellent security at this hotel .there be camera everywhere and yes , the front desk be behind a glass partition .rather than make I nervous by they mere existence , they really have make I feel safer.as for the room , i can not understand how other reviewer have describe this place as a basic , no-frills hotel .my room be extremely spacious , as be most of the other i have see in pass .all the room i have see have be renovate : the vanity be granite , with a new faucet .the bathtub surround be flat-panel stone , with none of the grout and tile that can be cover with mold .in fact , the bedroom and bath be spotless .there be a small , quiet refrigerator and a microwave that sit on granite shelf , and both be also completely clean .the king-sized bed be cover in a luxurious-looking burnt-orange shiny quilted new-looking bedspread .the bed itself could be a little softer , but it be not rock-hard either ; this non-sleeper have sleep well .even the entry doorsill and hinge have be replace .there be a desk , armoire , table , and three chair , and there be still a huge amount of room to walk around .the carpet be not old , but during my stay all of the room be have the carpet restretch and clean .the shower be good , with a new , adjustable showerhead .the lighting be good in the bedroom and bathroom , and there be two telephone .my only complaint be that the table and one of the chair could use replacement.the lobby be small , but furnish with newer furniture in excellent condition , and the small breakfast room be bright and modern , too.a number of people write about the somewhat seedy neighborhood .have drive back all the way on sunset from west hollywood to the hotel , the neighborhood do change - store and restaurant be close and largely ethnic , mostly hispanic .it certainly do not have the glitz and polish and lighting of the area i be come from .but not once do i feel unsafe .i do not use the underground parking , because the lobby be at one end of a small strip mall with outdoor parking , and i be able to park one foot away from the hotel lobby.after book this hotel by call choice 's 800 number , i later do a comparison on choice hotel 's own website among this hotel and four other comfort inn in the area .i be dismay to see that this be the only one that do not have high speed internet service list for the room .i be about to cancel my reservation , but then decide to call choice to verify it .they make a direct call to the hotel and tell I that they do indeed have high speed in all the room .i be use it right now , and it have work perfectly.i do not have a chance to check out the actual breakfast - i either sleep in or have to leave very early before they begin serve .but on my first morning i ask the desk after breakfast be over if i might be able to get some bread for toast .no problem .the guy at the desk call and get the woman in charge of breakfast to come down and get I some food .she give I a plate of bread and pastry and , of course , there be always coffee available.in closing , i must say that i be a snob about hotel .i absolutely can not stay in a old room ; i find it too depressing .and i be squeamish and easily skeeve , and will not tolerate anything that be not immaculate .also , i always stay in smoking room .this hotel room be not only one step away from be sterilize , it be also the only smoking room i have be in anywhere that do not have that nauseating , suffocating smell of stale smoke .and that go for the hallway , too , despite what one woman write about it .i can sniff out smoke anywhere , at any time , but not at this place .they be certainly do something right.this comfort inn have get to be the best deal in l.a. for $ 81 a night , you can not get better .and i would wager that you room in a high-rise hotel would not be any nicer .as long as you have a car and a map , it would be very short-sighted to stay somewhere else .if i return to l.a. , this will be my first , and only , choice ."

0,0,0,2,2,2,1,1,"plus and minus of cm punta cana as i always read review prior book my vacation , i want to post a review again this year.last year , my husband and twin boy of 20 month then , go to the melia caribe in they new concierge section in punta cana and we really like we experience .however , i would not have recommend the melia caribe if you be in they regular sections.i also want to point out that i have travel in europe , north america and caribbean and therefore i have a lot of point of comparison .here be my review for club med punta cana .the main reason we select this resort be because of the petit club , which take care of 2 and 3 year old .we need to rest and do not have a babysitter so we take that resort .for a week it cost we $ 6,800 can from montreal .so it be not cheap.here be the plus1 .contrary to other review , i feel that the care at the petit club be great .however , i can not talk for minus club , i.e. 4 and up .although the kid at the mini club be have a blast .the manager and assist manager be certify educator from belgium and france and the other staff member be either from canada , england or haiti and frankly they really try they best to entertain the kid .they do not just watch they as oppose to what go on that the petit club at the melia resort .however that be for the day schedule only as the night shift from 7:30 pm to 9pm they put they in front of a tv or bring they to the kid ' show if one be on that night .we have a issue one night be we kid be leave with one g.o. , the light be off and they do not do anything .we do not like how management deal with the problem , ie .confront we version and the go version .anyway , the day staff be great .2 .the facility for the petit club be great as they have a area to nap , it be super clean , they have a very strict schedule they report on what the kid do , eat .there be also a lot of area that be not directly expose to the sun to protect the kid鈥檚 skin .3 .if you want to practice a activity whether sailing or archery the g.o be all well trained and professional .4 .the way the club be set up be nice as you always have a view of the beach from the beach .5 .the pool be big and there be a big section for kid so parent be not restricted to a small baby pool .6 .regular wine offer during meal be ok , i.e. you do not really have to purchase a la carte as oppose to the other resort be the house wine be not drinkable .7 .overall facility be very clean .8 .we be located in the punta cana building behind the petit club and close to everything on the resort .9 .there be a doctor and a nurse on site .10 .the resort be 5 minute from the airport.here be the minus .1 .the facility need to be update as it be very old and do not stand up to the price they be ask .2 .there be only buffet .although the buffet be better than those at other resort , most respectable resort now offer at least one or two a la carte restaurant .my kid be use to go to restaurant and the buffet do not work .they do not understand why everybody keep leave they seat , we always eat cold and it be not relax at all to eat .we rest during the day while the boy be at the daycare but be exhaust after dinner .if you kid can serve themselves it might be better .other than that i would not recommend it .3 .go be always interact with you .while most of they be nice , after a few day , talk to 25 year old go be not we thing .4 .there be not bar service around the pool or at the beach or alcohol in the room .as a result , you always have to get you own drink and it make it more difficult to enjoy you vacation with the kid .5 .while the beach be good for kid as there be no wave at all , it be not exceptional .i be tell club med always have the best spot i be disappoint .the melia beach on the bavaro beach be much nicer .6 .the atmosphere be very kid camp in the sense that there be always one or two activity organize go on whether at the beach , at the bar -lrb- only one bar -rrb- or in the pool .consequently it be harder to relax .however , if you be the type who always seek to participate in game , it be you place .7 .if you kid be not use to go to daycare , they will have a hard time at the petit club .i see many kid cry because they be not use to daycare .there be a limit to what care provider can do .8 .the resort be huge so it be easy to be far away from the main activity .9 .once night come , there be not much do to for the kid .there be only the main bar or reception where light be on .around the pool , it be slippery so it make it hard for parent to have a drink as the kid do not have a place to play .10 .while the place be orient towards family , there be only a shower without a bathtub in the room , which make it harder with young one .also , once the child be in bed , you can either go in you bed or go outside to the smallest balcony every to relax .if you want a drink you have to go to the bar and brink it back to you room.in conclusion , i be not impress with the club med experience .maybe the go thing be not for I nor the buffet .my father be from france and i travel to europe many time as well as in north america and i be very disappointed .it be overprice .maybe the renovate club med be nicer .but i would hesitate to try one until the boy be older -lrb- 7 or 8 -rrb- .in the meantime , we will go back to the melia chain such as paradisius who now offer concierge room for family and we might try a beach resort ."

beforehand as i just didn鈥檛 know which hotel i should book .i keep reading review after review and in the end i just take a chance and book the grand hyatt , despite some of the bad reviews.i arrive at san francisco airport and get a taxi to the hotel .tip 鈥?only get in yellow meter cab , which will be wait outside baggage claim .do not go with the driver that stand and offer they service for a fix price .they will rip you off and often don鈥檛 have taxi licens .when we pull up at the hotel i pay the driver what be on the meter .he then say there be a extra $ 2 airport fee .i wasn鈥檛 really think at the time and i just pay it .when i get out of the cab i ask the receptionist if this be right and they say no .you only need to pay what鈥檚 on the meter .so please please please do not fool for this like i do !also , the driver be very surprise when i only tip he a dollar and mutter something rude in spanish .i don鈥檛 really see the need to tip a taxi driver anyway unless they have provide a exemplary service .that go for everything in america and as a english person i think it be quite frankly a disgrace the way a lot of american behave with the tip system .i couldn鈥檛 give a monkey that service be not include .people should only be tip if they have really earn it.anyway now on to the hotel !i have book a regency club king which be a high floor room with a king bed , 鈥榣uxury鈥?bath amenity and access to the regency club lounge .oh and let not forget you be on a private floor so you have to use you key card in the elevator to access it 鈥?this be really just for insecure people who like to look important when they be in a elevator .the receptionist be friendly and i be escort by the bellboy to my room .when i get to the room , there be two queen bed in it and like i say i have book a regency club king .i go back downstairs and ask what this nonsense be all about .i be tell that unfortunately they do not have any regency club room with king bed and that it be the only thing they could offer I .she try to make out that a king bed be not guarantee to which i reply 鈥?why be you advertise something you can鈥檛 produce ?i.e. false advertising .well i鈥檓 not a mug so i ask to see the manager .she try it on as well until i be about to leave and check-in to the westin st. franci instead 鈥?at which point she be able to find I a king bed on a high floor with a view of the financial district which be what i want .it wasn鈥檛 however on the regency club floor which mean i wouldn鈥檛 get to use my key card in the elevator .big loss !i do however make sure that the robe and 鈥榣uxury鈥?bathroom amenity be send to the room as i be still pay for a regency club room .by the way in case you be wonder , all room in this hotel be exactly the same .you just get a few extra luxury in a regency club room and access to the lounge.i enter the room and i be pretty happy overall .the room itself be a pretty standard hyatt room .you would think they would have flatscreen tv for the price you be pay and the day and age we live in but no obviously not .again , this didn鈥檛 really bother I .it be only a place to stay but the room be very presentable and well decorate i think .there be a ipod port on the bedside table which be a nice touch and there be plenty of drawer and cupboard space .the bathroom be what i be always most concerned about in a hotel room but it be very clean and welcome .the shower pressure be good and i didn鈥檛 encounter the problem of lukewarm water , which be often report on here .if i want boil hot water , that鈥檚 what i get .this be a relief as the frequent comment about this have worry I a little.one of the reason why i also book this hotel , be because it have window that open onto a small balcony and i can鈥檛 stand hotel room with window that don鈥檛 open .i stay in a skyscraper hyatt once with no window and you just don鈥檛 get any oxygen in the room .it鈥檚 awful if you be spray deodorant and hairspray or aftershave .how be you suppose to air the room ?the air conditioning ?!do I a favour .anyway i call the hotel before i book it to make sure that the window do open .i be tell by the front desk that they open to about 4 inch , and if you want they open fully you need to sign a release form as they have have a couple of suicide in the past apparently .this sound good except when i arrive i be tell that this be not the case anymore and hasn鈥檛 be for the last year and you be only allow to have the window open to the 4 inch mark .this wasn鈥檛 great to be honest and i be pretty annoy as i be tell something completely different .it also seem ridiculous to have a balcony you can鈥檛 even use .you may think i鈥檓 a very picky person but when you be pay this sort of money , you have every right to be picky.i have a view of the skyscraper of the financial district and the view really be spectacular , especially at night with all the building light up .it really be wonderful and one of the great thing about this hotel be the view you get from all the room , especially on a high floor.i have pay to have breakfast each morning in the grandview restaurant on the 36th floor .this really be spectacular to eat breakfast and look out over the whole of san francisco .probably one of the highlight of the hotel .the breakfast itself be very good .it be a small buffet but not too small .plenty of choice .the 鈥榝resh , 鈥?orange juice they offer you be clearly from a carton and i would expect freshly squeeze in a hyatt and for the price i be pay .they also bring you a complimentary small glass of a strawberry smoothie each morning , which for the record , be also from a carton .the breakfast staff be very nice .can be a little too talkative at time when you want to eat you breakfast in peace but i guess i should just lighten up a little.the staff overall in this hotel be absolutely superb .i be extremely impressed with all the staff here .everyone will greet you with a smile on they face , and all the staff be extremely courteous and helpful .this be very nice to see .the concierge be fabulous at this hotel and they really can not do enough for you .probably the best concierge i have ever come across and i travel a lot .this be very refreshing and extremely impressive .the regency club lounge be really nothing special .it be a small room on the 32nd floor and although the view be great , it鈥檚 not a very impressive room .they do a continental breakfast each morning which be ideal if you haven鈥檛 pay for the breakfast in the grandview restaurant .the hors d鈥檕euvres they serve in the evening be pretty poor .just a small buffet area of poorly present crudit茅s , brocollus throw in a bowl , dumpling and a few other random bit .it all just look like leave over from dinner and i鈥檓 pretty sure it be .there be also a bar area but you do have to pay for alcoholic drink .all soft drink be free which be handy for I as i could get a bottle of water whenever i wanted.i do not sleep well at all in this hotel .at about 8 o鈥檆lock every morning there be a click noise that come from something in the room .it be extremely annoying and there be no way i could sleep with that noise .it sound as though it be the air conditioning unit cool down but i didn鈥檛 ever even use the air conditioning unit .luckily i need to get up around that time anyway so i didn鈥檛 bother complain .the bed themselves be not bad at all .they be not the most comfortable i have ever sleep in but they be definitely comfortable enough.be very careful when check out of this hotel and read through the bill very carefully !they will try and charge you for the minibar even if you haven鈥檛 use it .i guess they do this just to cover themselves .they be very relax about take it off the bill so it be pretty obvious they do it all the time.i would probably stay somewhere else next time just to try something different .my experience here be good overall .it have its good point and bad point but i can not justify the money i pay for it .i think i will try the fairmont next time as it really do look spectacular and there be not much difference in the price.in term of restaurant , i wouldn鈥檛 bother with the grandview restaurant for dinner .the food do not get great write-up and the price be absolutely insane .you be just pay for the view .if you want to see the view then pay for breakfast in there .wouldn鈥檛 you rather say you go to a famous wolfgang puck restaurant for dinner than say you go to the hyatt for dinner ?trust I it鈥檚 the same price .avoid the local daily grill restaurant down the street .the hotel recommend this but my steak in there be absolutely appalling even though it be a steak restaurant .i go to the cardonian room restaurant which be at the top of the bank of america building -lrb- 2nd tallest building in san francisco -rrb- .the view be stunning and the food be ok 鈥?very small portion .i like nouveau cuisine but this be too small .do go on the movie tour if you get a chance .it鈥檚 a lot of fun .you鈥檒l be sick of the voice of the tour guide after 3 hour and hear about what film they have be extra in etc , but it be all good fun .some great film have be film in san francisco .obviously do alcatraz .you鈥檇 be stupid to go there and not to it .be extremely fascinating .get on the boat and go across to sausalito .very pretty town and nice to go there for lunch .the golden gate bridge be one of the most spectacular thing i have ever see and if you like walk , do walk across it as the view be stunning .i would recommend take the hop on hop off city tour on you first day to get you bearing and see a few of the site .you needn鈥檛 waste money get taxi around this city .everything be close-by and it鈥檚 very easy to jump on a tram which will only cost you just over a dollar .anyway if you have any question , do not hesitate to send I a message ."

andadin which work a treat .as there be malaria in dr we be worry it could be that but after look up the symptom on the internet be confident it be not .obviously on we return my wife go straight to she gp to confirm this .while we be there we hear other of other incident that reinforce we view that any medical treatment would be detrimental to you pocket .a friend with a ear infection be treat for a cost of 拢200 .while we be there we hear someone have contract gastro enteritis .the onsite doctor do manage to put this person on a drip , which be far more complicated than take a urine test .unfortunately this person do not get any better and have to spend 3 day in hospital at a cost of 拢2000 .i hope they be cover by they insurance .a rep also tell I of some other incident , i be not sure if these be sirenis specific .one of she guest be charge $ 500 to clear some ear wax .but the worst one be a woman who travel to the dr 7 month pregnant and give birth in she hotel room .the authority would not let the couple leave the dr until they could prove the child be theirs through dna testing .i suspect this be because dr have a history of child trafficking .this take a month and they be lucky that the hotel give they free accommodation .unfortunately they medical bill be 32,000 euros!if you be plan to travel to the dr make sure you have the best possible cover and do not travel if you be pregnant or have any pre-existing conditions.obviously the fact that my wife be allow to suffer needlessly for a couple day spoil the holiday to a certain extent and we would not go back to the same hotel after be treat that way .this be a shame as we think the rest of the hotel be excellent .we be fortunate that although my wife condition be very uncomfortable it be bearable .have the same thing happen to one of we child we would have be completely at the doctor mercy .roomshotel be split into two half 鈥?cocotal beach on one side and tropical suite on the other .its really one hotel with two type of accommodation as all the facility be share .we be in the tropical suite where the room have small lounge area with a sofabe .useful if you have a party of three but we do not really use it much as we be a party of four in two room .room be nice , with two tv and a fridge which be stock with water and soft drink daily .we be in block m which overlook the pool and have a great seaview .the only thing i didnt like about the room be that the air con be very weak .even though we leave in on constantly it never cool the room enough .i dont think it be a fault as we have two room and it be the same in both .the room be keep very clean and fault report to reception be deal with promptly .while we be there the water stop a few time and we have power cut .there be mosquito and we get bite quite a bit .as well as spray yourself remember to regularly spray the bottom of you door and the air vent in the bathroom.foodi wasnt impress by the evening buffet , the choice and quality be not great .the staff be excellent though as they be in all the restaurant .very friendly , very quick to supply drink and table be keep clean .the a la carte be much better .jade and the italian be excellent i thought and a real surprise after the buffet .bring a camera to jade as the chef will give you some good photo opportunity .we try all the a carte , didnt like the vegetarian , mexican or seafood .steakhouse be ok .we try the lobster restaurant which be $ 35 a head extra .the lobser be huge and we be glad we go .lunchtime buffet be ok and there be a bbq on the beach which i though be good for snack .try room service one day but be disappoint to find it the same food as in the buffet even though you have to pay for it .i could not see the point of that.one annoyance be the booking system for the a la carte .basically the guest service team would lbe econonic with the truth regard availability .they try to get you into unpopular time by say the restaurant be fully book when it be not or they will say a particular restaurant you want be close that night and point you to the mexican .for example we be tell we could only go to the italian at 18:30 one night as it be fully book .when we leave at 19:15 there be only one other table occupy .on another night friend of ours be tell the steak house be close on a night that we eat there.drinksi do not drink much alcohol so i cant vouch for the alcoholic drink .i do notice they be use mainly unbranded drink but i think they have brand if you specifically ask .the non alcoholic cocktail be great , a lot better on other all inclusive i have be on .the other major difference i notice be that it be very easy to get serve , there be no queue at the bar , probably because it be low season .even at reception if you be not at the bar you would be frequently ask by waitress if you want a drink.watersportswindsurfing , kayak , snorkel equipment and catamaran be all available free for a hour a day on all inclusive .for some equipment you be ask to pay $ 10 a day or $ 30 a week insurance .other watersport such as scuba diving , parasailing and banana boat be available for a fee .i normally scuba dive on holiday but didnt bother as i have read the diving wasnt great .i have dive other caribbean island before and they be not as good as the likes of the red sea or the maldive .i do try sailing a catamaran for the first time and i be really glad i do .i be give a lesson one morning and then allow to head off on my own .it be a bit difficult to start as the sailing area be shallow and full of coral so you endup get grouded very easily .once i be more confident i go into deeper water which be more fun , especially with the wave .i really enjoy the sailing even though i do manage to capsize it one afternoon .the watersport guy be great and have a proper lifeboat to pick I up and return I to the beach .the watersport guy be all very friendly and helpful .i think that once i have capsize the catamaran once they would be hesitant to let I go on it again as it be a hard work for they to get the catamaran back but they didnt mind and encourage I to go again .the sailing be one of the highlight of the holiday for I .pooltwo big pool each with shallow and deep area and a pool bar .the tropical side seem to be quieter and all the activity and load music be on the cocatal side .we go during the low season so i would say only half the sunbed be in use at any one time .lot of bed be reserve under umbrella but it wasnt hard to find one especially if you go on the beach .as there be so many empty bed every day i think there be no chance of any squabble over bed .unfortunately i be prove wrong .we leave towel on the bed only to find a couple have decide to take the bed and dump we towel .i really dont like argue on holiday so i ask they to move and even though they have lose 2 of we towel which be go to cost I $ 40 to replace i didnt make a fuss .unfortunately later in the day the couple french daughter and husband turn up and she launch into a almighty tirade against we because we have ask she parent to move .she be unbelievably rude , she swear at I and my wife and even at a little english girl that happen to be watch .in the end i decide that a shout match be not how i want to spend my time on holiday so i wish they a pleasant holiday and move on .i still cant believe how i manage to get into a argument over sunbed in a half empty resort .locationsirenis be about a hour taxi ride from the airport in a rural location .apart from a hotel either side there be local shop or town to visit so apart from excursion you be pretty much tie to the hotel .because the road be so bad it be not recommend to hire a car either .local tourist sight seem to be either cave or coffee/cacao plantations.entertainmentthe entertainment be probably the best we have see on holiday .daytime entertainment team be excellent .very funny guy , especially spaghetti .eddie and chico be also good .we have child aged 10 and 13 and although there do not seem to be activity directly for they they be allow to join in most of the adult activity .the daytime entertainment be good fun and well organised most of the time .my only gripe be that the some of the entertainment team use language not suitable with child around .the evening show be perform in a very profession theatre with a large stage , lot of seating and good sound and light .i be very impressed with the quality of the dancer , they seem very professional compare to what i have see elsewhere .unfortunately a lot of the show be dance theme so although very good they soon lose they appeal .there be a few show with audience participation which although very funny again contain material not suitable with child in the audience .i go to the casino a couple of time .lot of slot and three table .i play black jack and it must have be a training night when i go as there be a manageress overlook the dealer and i have never see so many error in add up or pay out before .quite funny to watch , the manageress be livid when a dealer be go to pay out $ 70 on what should have be a $ 30 win .my wife and daughter have some treatment in the spa and they say they be great.there be a game room opposite the doctor which have pool , table tennis and pool table .you have to pay for pool but the other be free .open in the evening but the light above the table tennis table be so dim you can hardly see the ball.excursionsthere be plenty of choice for excursion , swim with dolphin , swim with shark and ray , helicopter ride , speed boat , zip line , trip to island , snorkel , horse ride , buggy and atv , scuba diving.after reading report on the internet we do horse ride and atv with ramone who can be find on the beach if you go left .a very nice man and we really enjoy the trip especially the atv 's .we get to ride both the horse and the atv on the beach which be great .my daughter be not impress with the guy that take we horse ride though.friends of ours go parasailing and they be in a group of about 8 people .as a result they have to spend quite a bit of time on the boat for every to have they go and a few of they be sick .tippingi tip a lot more than usual on this holiday and be happy to do so as the service be so good and the staff so friendly.receptionspanish be the main language but most speak enough english to get by .reception staff least friendly and helpful in the hotel i think .when we arrive we be not give any information other than where the room be and a leaflet .they do arrange a nice surprise for we on we wedding anniversary though free of charge shopsthere be some shop at the entrance to the hotel and some hut either side of the beach .the shop sell beachware , battery etc. if you walk along the beach you will be approach by local to get you to go into the beach hut .they be polite though and will accept a no if you be not interested .all the hut sell pretty much the same thing .on the whole they be a friendly bunch but you do have to haggle which fortunately i love .i go to most of the hut and my favourite be a haitian guy call emanuelle .he shop be the farthest shop away on the right hand side of the beach past the watersport hut .he be the nicest , friendliest guy of the lot and be a great haggler .what set he apart from the other be that if you want something he do not have he would get it for you .for instance i need some suitcase lock , he get they for I the next day and he do not charge the earth.weatheri be expect weather similar to florida , hot with downpour of 30-60 minute and then hot again .we have two or three day when it rain for all morning hour and be cool all day .we then have a really big storm that last a whole day after which it be really hot for the rest of the holiday.transfers we book transfer online at http://www.dominicanairporttransfers.com/ and be very pleased with the service we get .the website be very professional and easy to use .we pay $ 150 return for 4 people .the car be very big , clean and have good air con .the driver be polite , drive well and turn up on time .on the trip to the hotel we have a 8 seater and on the way back a 10 seater .the road to the hotel be full of really big pot hole so we be glad we have a sensible driver .other driver be drive all over the road to miss the pot hole and be go too fast for the condition ."

1,1,0,1,2,0,1,2,"better than other i have be to i stay at this resort from february 10-17 .for a four start resort it be not bad , but i would not give it anymore than that.food : food be good , there be always a variety that change from day to day .during the day there be 3 buffet , in the evening there be 2 and there be 4 a la carte restuarant .there be also a 24hr snack bar which always have pizza , hot dog and hamburger .we only try the italian restaurant and it be very good .the operating hour of the buffet be actually off compare to what the brochure say they be , it say they open for 6 for dinner but do not actually open till 7:30 .but i must say they do have fairly long hours.staff : staff for the most part be good .it help that i speak basic spanish .for those who do not speak spanish , french or italian i could see they have a hard time .staff be also good by not demand or constantly stick out they hand for tip .maid service be good , they would always leave fresh towel and arrange any clothes that be leave out neatly to the side.beach : beach be amazing and gorgeous , but pack .go early if you want a lounge chair.bars : there be tonne of bar , and the liqour be always flow .they be very generous with the amount of liqour per drink.entertainment : the entertainment put a lot of effort into they performance and they could be quiet humerous .there be also what we think be a second entertainment pavillion .turn out it be , but it be strictly in italian .there be a vera club located within the resort which be a group of italian tourist that have a portion of the resort to they , they even have they own entertainment staff .you be able to join they , but it be of no use if you do not speak or understand italian .they also have they own water sport equipment and life jacket , so make sure you do not accidentally use they , we do this and they be not very pleased with us.excursions : there be plenty of excursion to go on , and they be all very entertaining especially the 4 wheeler excursion and the 4 runner tour , but be warn bring money with you because they be not cheap.we also like the fact that there be a town nearby .we take the bicycle tour offer by the resort which be free and they take we through the little village , it be quite interesting .also the nearby village be connect down by the beach and you can walk through .just be forwarn , when go into town , or even for a walk down the beach line , you will be harrass by the local sell thing ... my favourite line be hey canada , no pst , no gst.rooms : well this be where we be frustrated and annoyed .the first room they give we be in block 99 we put we luggage in and then go back to the front desk to get a saftey depost key , when we get back we key card would not open the door , so we go back to the front desk and then they re-program it , we go back and forth 4 more time with the door still not open until they finally send someone to fix it .the next day after breakfast the same thing happen .luckily we be on the ground level so we leave the slide door open so we could hope in through the balcony if it happen again , and it do .the room in block 99 be also very damp and musty smell no matter if you leave the window open or the air conditioing on .we complain again about the lock and they send another guy out to take a look at , after about 2 hour the guy finally show up and say that the lock be break and we would have to switch room .sick of the non-sense we make the man call the front desk to explain the situation directly .front desk say they would send the bell boy to pick up we luggage in 15 minute to transfer we room , needless to say it be 3 hour before he show up .we get transfer to block 98 which be directly off the second smaller pool .this be also the block that belong to the vera club .this room be 10x better and come with complimentary rum and fruit .we do have a problem with have no water but only one day for about 2 hour , and the only reason we notice be because the toilet would not flush .2 day after be in this room we t. .v. quit work .we go to front desk to tell they and they brush we off say that the satellite be not work we would have to wait .i know that what he be say be bull so i get a maid clean a room on we floor to let I try the t.v. to see if it be work and it be , i go back to the front desk fume and nedless to stay within 20 minute we have a brand new t.v. deliver to the room.overall besides any situation we have to involve the front desk in we have a great time .front desk be not helpfull at all , they actually make situation worse which be odd consider they be the only one that can speak proper english.our second last day we get a call from the front desk say that they have over book the hotel and be offer certain guest to transfer to a 5 + star hotel for they last day stay , bavaro pay for the accomodation , as well as give each person $ 150 american per person just for take the offer .needless to say we take the offer and be transfer to the melia tropical caribe .it take we 2 hour to get settle there because ocean bavaro be late confirm the arrangement .once we get settle it be definatley worth it .the hotel be amazing .next time i be in the dominican i will be stay at the melia caribe tropical .it make the ocean bavaro seem like a 2 star ."
2,2,1,-1,2,-1,2,-1,"great value , many convenience i have stay at the terrace inn about a dozen time for business .i have always find it clean and comfortable .here be what i like about the terrace inn : free , easy parking ; friendly , helpful staff ; kitchenette in all room ; free wireless ; cheap !if you book directly with this location you can often get the mid-week manager 's special which be only about $ 70 -- unbeatable in this market .the hotel be very close to bc and bu .it be one block away from a whole food market , which be where i usually get my dinner .there be also many small restaurant nearby .there be a t stop about a block away , but the b line -lrb- comm ave -rrb- be incredibly slow , stop on nearly every street corner .in good weather it may be faster to walk down to beacon street and catch the c line .-lrb- it may be faster in bad weather too , but the walk would be brrrrrrrr ! -rrb-i usually skip breakfast , but they do provide basics : cheerio -lrb- plain -rrb- , froot loop , yogurt , toast , english muffin , pastry -lrb- not so appetizing -rrb- , hard-boiled egg , juice , coffee , tea .i wish they offer fresh fruit .the breakfast room be very pleasant and be open until about 10 pm ; guest can use the microwave -lrb- no nuke in the kitchenette -rrb- , as i often do .good cable selection , include hbo .if you do not have a laptop you can use the computer in the lobby for free .a printer be also available but i do not know what the charge be per page -lrb- if there be one -rrb- .the water pressure in the shower be fairly weak , as be typical of hotel in this category .if you have a lot of hair budget extra time for shampoo !the toiletries be very basic -- one reviewer complain about they but they seem fine to I .there be hairdryer in the rooms.an earlier reviewer complain about the bed but i have not have any problem , perhaps because i like a firm mattress.my regular room be a little dark -- they keep low-wattage bulb in the lamp .i have stay in a couple of hampton inn recently -lrb- not in boston -rrb- and they be much nicer , but also much more expensive .as a two-star hotel the terrace inn be amazing .as a three-star it be still pretty good .if you be on a budget and do not need name-brand shampoo or mint on you pillow , look no further !"
0,0,1,-1,0,-1,0,-1,"what a costly disappointment !!!this be a lengthy review that i hope will discourage you to book you vacation at this resort .i wish i have listen to other and not stay here.i will first start with the positive - as they be fewer in number!the beach be beautiful - the ocean water be shallow for about 20 foot , and have a completely sandy bottom .the water be warm and the ` seaweed ' be not the slimy stuff usually find elsewhere , and it be rake away all day by a crew of workers.the sand be white and soft and not so hot that you burn you foot .the beach lounger be plentifuly and comfortable .there be some shaded area for those who prefer to stay in the shade , but they be take fairly early in the day , so plan accordingly.now , on to the not-so-positive : the resort be nice enough - maybe a 5 star in dominican standard , but definitely no more than a 3 + by most standards.the room be average in size and upkeep - the musty smell must be a by-product of the 70 - 100 % humidity .the air conditioner work well , but be hard to regulate to the ideal temperature -lrb- either way too cold or too warm -rrb- .and finally , on to the negative : this resort most definitely cater to its own !!i would not say they be anti any particular nationality but more that they be pro they own -lrb- or at least all those that speak spanish or any derivative i.e. cuban -rrb- .we go out of we way , especially after read some of the comment here , to attempt to communicate in spanish from the moment we arrive at the resort .the staff at the reception desk be less than welcome to say the least .they could barely be bother to check we in .as a matter of fact , we be pass over 2x by staff until a gentleman half-heartedly check we in .the female at the front desk be rude !!!beyond belief .i even ask if speak italian would be helpful , since i could not speak that much spanish and the two language be similar .other than for 1 staff member , that be meet with complete hostility too.our first room be a joke !it be in building 1 -lrb- along with building 3 -rrb- which be the worst building to stay in .the balcony on all the room other than those that directly face the ocean -lrb- oceanfront only , not oceanview -rrb- be half-balcony .they be a small traingular shape !!after press the guy at reception 3 x more the next day , we be move to a oceanfront room in building 2 .same room setup , but full rectangular balcony right on the beach -lrb- same money - go figure -rrb- .the food - very disappointing !!the palace be consider the best of the resort , yet the food leave a lot to be desire .we think that breakfast be the best meal offer at the palace - unless you be really into dominican food all the way .the buffet at the beach resort be fairly well round .the steak house be decent - ask for you steak no more than medium , otherwise its very chewy .and definitely get there by 6:30 or so , otherwise you will be wait in line a long time .p.s. there be a couple of spanish speak group that come in the restaurant from the beach look to scoop a table or two without have to wait in line .the italian restaurant at the caribe be ok .la brisa , the seafood restaurant , be ok .do not know what all the rave be about re : the lobster they serve .mine and my husband 's lobster be small and overly grilled , and the garlic shrimp i order on the side be no bigger than salad shrimp and be very chewy .drink - they may be tasty , but for those of you who like to drink and get a buzz be warn - do not bother with mixed drink because they have next to no alcohol in they .i only drink for taste , so this be ok because i could drink several pina colada and not feel in the least bit tipsy .on the whole , you pay a lot of money for a all inclusive meal plan that be very dissatisfying.the staff - rude , condescending , inconsiderate , unaccomodating , and totally ok with you watch they treat ` they own ' like king and queen .in the 8 day and 7 night that we be there , and in the 5 resort that make up the barcelo bavaro beach resort , we encounter only 3 staff who be pleasant , kind , helpful and courteous .the rest , in the bar , restaurant , shop , public relation , tour desk etc. be pathetic .especially the female staff - they do not even try to hide the fact that they would look you up and down once or twice first before decide if they be go to even speak to you .keep in mind , these same staff be smile and serve spanish speak guest all around we at the same time that we sit and wait 10 minute for cutlery so we could eat we food , or 20 minute before have a glass of water pour , or we drink order taken.lastly - tropicalissimo - they say its like a vegas show !pleeaasse !!if you like raunchy , over sex , untalented people - by all means , go to the show .vegas offer beauty , talent and barely dress showgirl .tropicalissimo offere very barely dress girls.all in all , by the 2nd day i be wish i have go somewhere -lrb- anywhere -rrb- else , by the 5th day i could not wait to go home , by my final day i start get downright rude right back !!!please , look at another resort !!!"

1,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,"so-so soho my partner and i just return from europe which include a 4-night/3 - day stay at the vincci soho in madrid .i must first say that read the other review of this hotel -lrb- and other -rrb- on the tripadvisor site be a huge help to I .the other review be decidedly mix on this hotel and i even exchange direct email with one recent reviewer from the state for more info before leave .while none of the review turn I against stay here , they do provide some great info which be exceedingly helpful in know what to expect before we arrived.thankfully , in real life the hotel look every bit as it do online , so there be no surprise .the vincci soho be 4-star rate ultra-modern/boutique-y hotel .as far as the star go , i guess it live up to that as far as european standard be concern .we find the hotel and room well appoint , immaculately clean and everything in work order .the rate be decidedly not for those on a tight buget , but they be reasonable for a hotel of this type in a big european city i would say .be advise that it be a very modern/sterile motif , devoid of any local character or charm , though the outside front be nice enough look and blend in very well with the neighborhood .after read the review here , i be advise about two thing with this hotel ; odd room shape/size/location and the noise level.with regard to the room shape/size/location , we room be in the adjacent building of the hotel -lrb- there be apparently 2 different building join together -rrb- , directly behind the front building , and we room face the back street -lrb- not the side street -rrb- , which require walk down long corridor and two different elevator to get to we room only on the 3rd floor .that be a bit of a drag , but not too big a deal .the room be moderate/modest size -lrb- almost large by european standard but border on small by we standard -rrb- , but even by we comparison , it be adaquate for the two of we without feel cramped .but the room be at very sharp and strange angle , which waste space and be disturb to the eye .even the bathroom , which be decent size , have a odd angular shape .we do have a double-door/window and tiny balcony/ledge face the back street , which be nice .and the bed be exceedingly comfortable and there be a flat panel wall mount tv .the room be a bit too warm for we -lrb- from what we be use to at home in sf bay area where we prefer to sleep with much cooler room temp at night -rrb- and repeat attempt to lower the thermostat bring no real relief .we end up have to sleep with the window crack , which be a blessing and a curse.we find the entire hotel staff to be nice , professional and courteous .it should be note that we do not speak spanish fluently , but thanks to lviing in can where lat-am spanish be widely speak , we be able to pick up enough of the very basics , and , together with a great spanish travel phrase book -lrb- by baron 's -rrb- , be able to fend for ourselves without problem and only rarely trouble the staff for help or info .when we do , there be always someone at the front desk who speak fluent english and be very helpful to we .another reviewer have some issue with the staff on a recent stay before mine , but we do not.with regard to the noise level , well ... madrid be one of the -- if not the most -- noisiest city in all of europe .without stay at a 5-star + establishment at perhaps doulbe the price , there be probably no way to totally avoid it .we be advise by other to ask for a room face the inside courtyard of the hotel , which we do , but be tell at check in that the hotel be fully book and no room of that type be available .i guess the next best location be we room face the back .the back street be a narrow alley-like access and not a main street with lot of foot or car traffic , thankfully , so you do not get anywhere near the same level of noise that you would get in a front face room , which i would say be to be avoid if at all possible .as mention , we sleep with the window open at night , which dramatically increase the noise that we do here from the back , but it be infrequent , with long period of relative quiet in between .the biggest noise disruption by far be the nightly garbage collection .they seem to go out of they way to make as much nosie as be humanly possible empty can into dumpster from hotel and restaurant to be pick up by the city truck all of which occur only in very the middle of the night .it really be almost beyond belief that this racket presumably go on nightly city-wide .the double-paned window/door do block out some of it , so keep they close if you can .we decide we need cooler air at night more than we need the quiet .interior noise from the other room in the hotel can also be a concern -lrb- there be hardwood flooring almost everywhere -rrb- .late one afternoon we be bother by a large group of very noisy people in the room above we , but it be a one-time occurance and only last for a short while .soundproofing be not this hotel 's claim to fame.but aside from all of this , the hotel 's big , big plus be its location .it simply can not be beat .the vincci soho be located in the very heart of the nice part of central mardid and be within a easy 10 to 15 min walk of almost every main tourist attraction -lrb- include the museum -rrb- or most other place that one would want to go .you can even walk there to/from the main rail station -lrb- atocha -rrb- .the mardid metro be very good , but we take it only once or twice in 3 full day because it be so close and easy to walk everywhere from this hotel.the hotel overall be a mixed bag .i would not recommend it for the biz traveler who have some money to stay in a more soundproof central location .i would also not recommend it to the budget traveler count they euro , or to someone look for more local charm and character in they surroundings -lrb- it remind I a lot of some of the w hotel in this country -rrb- .it be not cheap -lrb- although reasonably price for a place of this caliber and location -rrb- and as mention be very modern and sharp/hard in decor .certainly somewhat sterile if not cold .we eat dinner one night in the hotel restaurant , which be okay at best , but expensive .go elsewhere for much better and cheaper food -- there be ton of great place just minute away.however , all thing consider , i would highly recommend this hotel to a well seasoned european vacation traveler who be only go to be in madrid for a short while -lrb- i would not stay in this hotel , or even madrid , for longer than 3 day -rrb- and who want to be cool and close to virtually everything without a car or long and tiring walk ."

.yet the european be treat far better than we be .i be honestly dumfound that i be treat this way here and it leave a very bad taste in my mouth for the region and the hotel .also there be two seperate occasion where the power go out at the resort .it be out for hour .we be also tell by the front desk it be not safe to leave the resort and not to be on the beach at night .i would have love to experience some of the culture without be require to pay $ 100 or more for a day trip .so we do not venture outside of the resort area 's ... we walk to the other riu resort of course ... without

0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,"i would not go back 4 star ?i think not.truth be tell , punta cana be a beautiful place but i probably wouldn鈥檛 go back there anytime soon .this be because of the terrible service and attitude we receive while we stay at this resort .the simple truth of the matter be all the negative and bad thing that happen to we while we be there outweigh all the good things.for starter , the layout of the resort be stupid .you have hotel on one side of the resort , and you have the restaurant and sport bar on the other side .to get to these attraction , you need to wait 10 minute for the train to come .then you need to find a seat on this packed train -lrb- or wait another 10 minute for the next one -rrb- , take a 15 minute train ride to the other side of the resort to visit one of the a la cart restaurant .once there , you will be tell that there be a wait time of anywhere from a hour to two hour -lrb- for a party of 5 -rrb- , and that you will need to take a pager and they will call you .oh yeah , they also don鈥檛 take reservation -lrb- unless you stay in the suite -rrb- .sunchair .every review i read say there be plenty available and be not a issue .every morning someone from we group would wake up at 6:30 be to reserve 5 chair .otherwise , by 8am there be not a single chair available .we learn this the hard way the first day.鈥淒o you like to snorkel ?scuba ?dune buggyy ?atv ?speedboat ?fishing ?be prepare to say yes or no a hundred time !!my god , i have never be so annoyed in my entire life .we be seriously ask if we want to participate in one of these activity at least 20 time a day .this be not a exaggerated number .sometimes you鈥檇 get up to go to the washroom and in a span of 100 meter 3 different people would come up to you with they binder try to get you to sign up for something.service overall be hit and miss .some of the waiter be very nice and we tip they extremely well .by far the best bartender on the entire resort be william .he usually work the swim up bar in the pool with the deep end .all the other bartender be hit and miss .sometimes the drink taste the same , sometimes they don鈥檛 .there鈥檚 no consistency .but that鈥檚 just the bartender .the lobby waiter who ask you if you want a drink be nowhere to be see .that鈥檚 more of management fault though because there be usually only one person work the entire lobby .restaurant waiter be hit and miss as well .browlio -lrb- who work at multiple restaurant -rrb- be the only good waiter in my opinion .the rest of the waiter be just do they job as far as i鈥檓 concern .the waitress in the mexican a la cart show up with this attitude and ask 鈥測eah what do you want鈥?which be she way of say 鈥淗i welcome , what can i get for you?鈥?br / > the maid ... here be where thing get interesting .the room be nice , and relatively clean .but there be some issue .the bed cover be not wash between guest -lrb- you can tell because they smell funky -rrb- .the white bed sheet be clean though .towel be ridiculous .no consistency what so ever .one maid would come in the morning -lrb- 9am -rrb- to remove you towel .another maid would come later to give you fresh towel -lrb- hopefully -rrb- .i have a feeling they do thing this way because they didn鈥檛 have enough towel to go around and would rewash the same towel every day .otherwise this be just impractical .another maid would come to make you bed and i guess tidy up .so when you tip the maid , i鈥檓 not sure who exactly get this money .two funny side note , 1 -rrb- there be a half drink bottle of beer next to my tv for the entire duration of my visit .one of the previous guest must have leave it there .i be curious to see how long it would take the maid to clean it .it be still there by the time i leave .2 -rrb- the maid don鈥檛 knock -lrb- hola/hello housekeeping be not in they vocabulary -rrb- .one of my friend be on the toilet while the maid walk into the room and then the washroom -lrb- without knock on either door -rrb- .the room in general be quite nice .the picture be a little misleading though .the jacuzzi be you bathtub and it be in the washroom .in the picture i see prior to go , it be locate in you main room .this might be the case in the suite .not a huge deal , but it be a little disappointing.food .not bad , but not great .food be one of these thing that many of we might disagree on .what i might consider great , you might consider disgust , and vice versa .so i鈥檒l keep thing very generalize .the selection at the main buffet be great , but it be the same menu every day .everything be fry .pan fry , deep fried , it have a lot of oil .the a la cart be a bit better in term of quality .but try get into one without a reservation -lrb- one hour wait minimum if you show up after 7:30 pm -rrb- .i didn鈥檛 get sick , but two of my friend do -lrb- 2 out of a group of 5 鈥?those aren鈥檛 good odds -rrb- .on a side note 鈥?take gravel , tum , pepto bismol with you .you will definitely need something for the heart burn after all those citrus alcoholic beverage and all the oil you will consume .there be a store in which you can buy these thing -lrb- as well as sunscreen , sunglass , clothes , souvenir , etc -rrb- , but be prepare to get rip off .tum which cost $ 2.50 cnd , be $ 11 usd there .sunscreen - $ 5 dollar here , $ 20 there.the shop in general be pretty stupid .very over price , bad service -lrb- big surprise -rrb- , and don鈥檛 go by the hour in the window because they don鈥檛 believe in they and neither should you .if you鈥檙e go to buy alcohol , wait until you get to the duty free in the airport.i could keep go , but i think i鈥檝e make my point .the negative outweigh the positive .all the thing that be suppose to make this resort a 4 star be not there.final point 鈥?i would recommend this place to family because the staff love kid .this be very obvious and i be glad to see they treat someone right .i go on vacation with two couple .single guy 鈥?this be not the resort for you .lol .i can not stress this point enough .punta cana be very much a couple / family destination ."

0,0,2,2,2,1,1,2,"the good i recently book a room for four night at the hotel california through hotwire .naturally , room book through hotwire be less desirable , which explain my second floor interior room face the alley .i really do not mind the fact that my room face the alley -- in fact , i be glad as i assume that would help cut down on the street noise .however , i digress .let I point out the good point of the hotel california : location -- you be less than three block from all the action of union square .very centrally located and easily accessible to all other point of the city via public transportation .some reviewer mention the safety of the neighborhood -- i think the neighborhood be fine , even at night .i never feel threaten or fearful for my safety .however , you be just a few block away from the shady/seedy tenderloin district of san francisco .so be sure you be know where you be go , direction-wise .value -- a very good value , especially when book through hotwire or other off-price venue -lrb- priceline -rrb- .however , you have no idea what hotel you be book until you pay .compare to most hotel rate in san francisco , i feel i snag a real bargain.the bed !-- the bed in my room be by far one of the most comfortable bed i have ever sleep in .they have more than enough pillow -lrb- six pillow for one queen size bed -rrb- and the sheet and down comforter be what you would typically find at more high end hotels.free internet access be available to guest in the hotel lobby -- a nice touch when you want to look up the weather , local restaurant , direction , etc.room comfort/amenities -- the room , although small -lrb- but perfectly standard for san francisco -rrb- , be cozy and well appoint with bright yellow wall , unique art print and polish hardwood floor .the room be very clean and also boast a decent closet with a iron and iron board and in-room safe .the room also have a small write desk as well as a dresser and the usual coffee maker , ice bucket , television , etc. the plantation shutter shades be a nice touch , however they do tend to let a good bit of light in -lrb- not good if you like the room nice and dark -rrb- .clean and functional bathroom -- the bathroom be small , but perfectly functional .however , the bathroom do need to be update -lrb- the lighting fixture be rusting over and the toilet seat be chip and wear -rrb- .nice lobby and fairly friendly staff -- the lobby complement the feel of the hotel .the staff for the most part be professional and courteous , however they be not overly friendly .the hotel staff 's personality/attitude do not affect my stay , however , i think i would point it out .i will say that if you have a question or a request , they do they best to answer/honor it.wine and cheese -- every afternoon from 4:00 - 6:00 p.m. , the hotel offer wine , cheese and fruit to guest .that be a nice touch.now for the bad of hotel california : room noise -- by far , the worst aspect of the hotel and room be the noise one experience .although the hardwood floor be pretty to look at , they do nothing to mask the noise of footstep up above you .for some reason , the guest directly above I decide to walk around they room non-stop for two hour -lrb- from 11:00 p.m. - 1:00 a.m. -rrb- every night .they also enjoy drop shoe -lrb- or something heavy -rrb- on to the floor every 15-20 minute .the wall of the room be very thin and you can hear every word of you next door neighbor ' conversation -lrb- which do provide some entertainment -rrb- .same go with the hallway ; it sound like the people in the hallway be walk right through you room .apparently , there be very little or no insulation in the hotel.room darkness -- due to my room 's location -lrb- mine be a interior room on the second floor that be less than a foot from the hotel 's skylight -rrb- , the skylight that be directly beneath my window have a constant light on that totally light up my room every night -lrb- it be like the bat-signal shine directly in you room -rrb- .i have to go out and purchase a eye mask at walgreen 's down the street after the first night .the handsome plantation shutter , although pretty to look at , do little to filter the light from the skylight below .also , whenever the neighbor directly across the alley turn on they bathroom light , my room would light up even more .needless to say , between the light and sound situation , i find it very difficult to sleep .i think this also have to do with the room location .but that be what you get when you book through hotwire -lrb- the less or least desirable room -rrb- .then again , it be hard to beat hotwire 's rates!one final note , i be not offer the frosted tequila shot when i check in .i be not bother by this as i really do not care for tequila .i be not sure if this be a oversight , but just think i would mention it as i notice other reviewer mention the same thing.overall , the value and location of the hotel far outweigh the negative of the hotel california .just be prepare to know what you be get yourself in for .if you be look for a charming , unique boutique hotel with ton of character and personality , this be the place for you .if you be a light sleeper , be sure to bring the earplug and eye mask.finally , i will close my review by state that i would stay at the hotel california again , but only if i could be guarantee a room on they top floor , which should eliminate the non-stop footstep noise from above.enjoy san francisco -- it be a wonderful city !"

not conducive to a good night sleep .now to the good part .the bathroom be fantastic , very large , beautiful deep tub , design perfectly and in total contrast to the main room .finally , the most

negative point : the balcony decor be cheap and tacky , very basic and secondly we balcony view be impede by about 60cm cement wall before the view actually start -lrb- we notice most floor have a

house without a key .there be not a huge selection and the pastry be truly terrible , however we be more than happy with it , there be something for everyone .the service be always fantastic and again my name be remembered every time i go into the restaurant .i be also impressed that all tax tip be include in we breakfast package.we also have the most wonderful lunch at house without a key , a beautiful seafood pasta that be divine , the quality be just fantastic .while we sit at this restaurant we really feel that we be mile away from waikiki bustle .just brilliant.we also have a wonderful afternoon tea , which i highly recommend , the quality of the food be fantastic , the service very personalised and it be just lovely.spaas part of we package i receive a free massage .again i be impressed that all cost include tax and tip be cover .the spa be lovely although certainly do not compare to the spa in asia .the service be great and the treatment be nothing like i have ever receive .they really try to create something altogether different .i be most happy and the final touch be great .you get to sit out in a the spa courtyard with a ice tea and frozen fruit skewer for as long as you like , a perfect end to a great treatment .overviewoverall there be element to the halekulanus that be unique and fantastic and then other part that be really disappointing .i also come to my own conclusion that there maybe be a reason why some people love the halekulanus and other hate it .if you have never be to a 5 star asian resort , with they low rate , deluxe room and fitting , divine food , endless buffet then the halekulanus will probably blow you away .but if you have , then you will know that there be better out there at far more value for money .in say that i do believe that the halekulanus be unique to the waikiki area as be definitely the best hotel if you be on you honeymoon or want a very quiet holiday .would i go back , i do not think so , although i be happy that i go .go for 2 or 3 night and judge for yourself .i would definitely only recommend go if you can get yourself a package deal .we pay $ usd600 per night that include daily breakfast for two , a afternoon tea for 2 , a lunch for 2 and a free massage for 1 and a late checkout to 4pm .with all these addition i end the stay satisfy that i get good value for money .now if i do not receive any additional benefit i would definitely have feel short-changed .anyway i hope that this help and enjoy you holiday!ann"

2,2,1,2,1,2,1,0,"just fine for we .great stay .this hotel be great for the price .i be pleasantly surprise after read some of the other review on this site .we book a package deal with flight through a tour provider , so i don鈥檛 know what the rate be .i鈥檓 guess they be about $ 100 a night for 6 night in mid-february .we be primarily there for the police concert -lrb- which rock btw -rrb- so the hotel didn鈥檛 concern we much .it鈥檚 not like we be on we honeymoon , and we don鈥檛 typically stay at plush place anyway .as long as the hotel be safe , clean and quiet , we be ok .the waikiki resort hotel be all three .prior to arrive , i鈥檇 email the hotel鈥檚 customer service department and ask for a room away from the elevator because i always end up near the elevator .when we get there , the room they initially assign to we be on the 9th floor directly across from the elevator .as soon as we get in the room , i call the front desk and explain my earlier request .they move we to another room right away .they even let I look at it first -lrb- with a security guard -rrb- .in fact , adam at the front desk be very helpful .we take the second room on the 18th floor .it be penthouse e. but before you get excite , the penthouse be the same as other room .nothing different .we have two full bed and a fridge .the room be clean , as be the whole hotel .the ac hadn鈥檛 be turn on and be lock , so i call adam again .he say he鈥檇 send a maintenance man asap .when the maintenance man didn鈥檛 arrive after about 25 minute , i call adam again and he apologize profusely and the maintenance man be at we door in 5 minute .later in we stay , the ac get lock again in the on position -lrb- a little too cold -rrb- and we call again .a maintenance man be there right away to adjust it .this time , my husband watch how he unlock the thermostat in case we need to do it again .the view from the room be the neighborhood and hill behind the hotel .since we didn鈥檛 spend a lot of time in the room that be fine .at night , the view be very cool .the light from the house on the hill curve and remind we of lava flow down the hill .very cool.speed of the elevator be fine.the shower be tiny .i have to figure out a way to shave my leg w/o get water on the floor .my husband be very tall and the showerhead height be ok for he .but if you be a heavy person , the shower stall will definitely be too small for you .we leave we maid $ 2 each day and we request for more towel on the first day be fill and we never have to ask again .we didn鈥檛 request clean sheet every day -lrb- in fact we tell the maid to leave they -rrb- .we don鈥檛 change the sheet every day at home , why would i waste laundry water somewhere else ?we get lotion , shampoo and soap .the vent in the toilet/shower stall area be filthy inside , but since you don鈥檛 spend a lot of time in there , who cares?the good : price , cleanliness and quiet .this be a small hotel compare to most in waikiki or honolulu .it鈥檚 really not a resort , though that鈥檚 in the title .and i be fine with that .several friend stay at the hawaiian hilton village -lrb- hhv -rrb- .wow .that鈥檚 a huge resort .it keep go and go .everything be sooooo expensive -lrb- food , drink -rrb- and it be very , very , very busy .there be always a long line to check in .the hhv have a lot of bar , restaurant and shop , but it be too bustling for my taste .we be ok with the lay back atmosphere at waikiki resort hotel -lrb- wrh -rrb- location : less than a block to the beach in front , less than a block to the bus stop on the street behind the hotel .a mcdonald鈥檚 and burger king w/in a minute鈥檚 walk and starbuck and subway w/in a 4 minute walk .there be three abc store w/in a 2 minute walk , two in front of the hotel and one behind .the beach be a 60 second walk .it鈥檚 pretty busy in that area , but walk a few minute toward diamond head and the park and the beach be less packed .ritzy shopping be just a few block away as be the zoo and aquarium.my husband rent a longboard and the bell hop store it for $ 5 a day , which be very convenient .the local surfer be helpful to he too , which he鈥檇 hear be not always the case .but surf be fine.refrigerator 鈥?buy beer and water at abc , save $ $ $ $ $ .the staff be pleasant/helpful each time we speak with they .ask for the bus map.the bad : the business center didn鈥檛 have a printer so i couldn鈥檛 print we board pass to fly home .that seem stupid .the hotel should get a printer and charge people 5 cent for a sheet of paper if they be worry about waste .the business center be $ 7/hr .i hear -lrb- but do not confirm -rrb- that the hhv be $ 7.50 for 15 minutes!shower size 鈥?already discussedpool 鈥?it be nothing to write home about .very sparse area .if you want a fabulous poolside experience , you need to go to someplace like the hhv -lrb- though hhv be very strict about what can go in the pool 鈥?no beach ball , no kid floaty , etc. -rrb- the room door be heavy and noisy .even if you try to shut they quietly , they bang .this be the only noise we hear from we neighbor except when they talk in the hall .we could not hear they in the next room.notes : the city bus to the pearl harbor/arizona memorial take a hour to get there and 80 minute to get back .cheap and easy , but if you don鈥檛 have the time to spare , take a shuttle -lrb- not a cab ! -rrb-the bus be very easy to use but we do find that there be fewer route on the weekend and evening so we have to take cab a few time to get to place on time.do not try to walk to the diamond head visitor鈥檚 center .it鈥檚 too far combine with the hike to the top -lrb- which be totally worth it -rrb- .take the bus there.we find a great hole in the wall for breakfast .leave the hotel and go to the street behind it where the bus stop be .turn leave at the abc store on the corner .walk straight until you see a tiny little park -lrb- like a triangle -rrb- with a statue of a woman and a goose -lrb- ? -rrb-in the middle .there be a restaurant call hula girl -lrb- not to be confuse with the expensive hula grill at one of the beach hotel -rrb- on the side street on the side of the park closest to diamond head and wrh .if the waitress call you 鈥減retty lady鈥?or 鈥渉andsome man , 鈥?you鈥檙e in the right place .the waitress alone be worth the 5 minute walk !the food be very reasonably price compare to other places.if you

-rrb-be break .there be big bathtub and a very small shower in the washroom .we never use the bathtub , i would have prefer to have a bigger shower and no tub .be careful with the water come on the floor out of the shower .on the negative side , my mom say she see two cockroaches鈥搇ike bug in we washroom one night .i never see any鈥 aybe because i never turn on the light !also , there be some small ant if you leave any food in the room so try not to do that .we be in villa 9 and we be not impress with we maid at all .never have a ashtray , ask but never get it .ask for a iron and nothing happen .if feel like bed sheet be never change , and overall we didn鈥檛 feel welcome at all .the day we be leave , the maid start clean we room at 11 , while check out be 12 -lrb- and usually she would come in at around 3pm .! -rrb-we do leave tip , but didn鈥檛 see the difference .at sirenis , we maid be very smiley and welcome and always leave flower on we bed .it probably depend on which villa you get in .also , be prepare that it be very dark in the room so you would not be able to read at night in the room.food : my mom didn鈥檛 like the fool in comparison with the sirenis .you can always find what to eat but there be limit choice .we also didn鈥檛 like the setting of the main restaurant .it be very dark in it in the evening and not welcome .we didn鈥檛 like the restaurant system of wait until you get site .in the other resort , we could have stay whenever we want .service be not good , sometimes non-existent , one night , we have we all dinner with no one come to we and ask if we want any water , tea or wine .most of the time , we go to get we own tea and coffee .overall , we find the staff not very welcome , most of the time we feel like people didn鈥檛 care .we never have a desire to tip , as we do at sirenis .overall , at sirenis , we find the whole atmosphere much better , waiter be always smile , singing and dancing , all staff on the resort be much more open , happy and welcome than in catalonia .most of the time , we have lunch and breakfast at the beach restaurant and it be ok .definitely try pizza at the pool bar -lrb- 12:30 鈥 ?5:30 -rrb- 鈥?it鈥檚 delicious , they also have burger , chicken , nacho there which be also good .beach : overall , i be disappoint with the ocean .as a good swimmer , i find limited opportunity to swim far and have fun , the ocean be very shallow , there be a lot of seaweed , which i never find like that at the sirenis -lrb- only one day after a storm ! -rrb-.it be however beautiful to look at it -lrb- combination of different blue color be amazing ! -rrb-.i do some snorkeling and see some fish but it wasn鈥檛 exciting .there be seaweed on the beach as well , but staff try to clean it every day , several time a day .it be nice and breezy on the beach , except for the last few day before the rain come and the weather be change , the wind get so strong , and we couldn鈥檛 stay on the beach so we relocate to the swimming pool .don鈥檛 know how people stay beside the beach , i feel like i fire myself in 15 minute .there be a lot of sunbed available but palapa be limit .most people reserve palapa at night , before leave the beach , they would leave they towel to save the spot for the next morning , which i think be not fair to other people , as whoever wake up first should have the spot .other : there be local shop on the right side of the resort , and one on the left .bargain , bargain and bargain again!we do parasailing and it be lot of fun !highly recommend if you haven鈥檛 do that before .animation team be great !overall , we have a good time , as it be all about what you make out of you stay , however , we will not come back.best regard , happy traveler ."

2,1,0,-1,2,-1,1,-1,"overall a good choice we travel together with another family - four adult , two teens and a six year old .we book through apple vacation at the beginning of january .because the week we want be april/easter break , most of the resort be already fill .dominicana be not we first choice , but it turn out to be a great place to stay .this be we fourth dominican vacation.the 45 minute to the resort seem like a really long ride , but check in be easier than most .you be give a envelope with wrist band , towel card , key and info , then send to a table for orientation .we skip this part and go directly to we room .keep in mind that room assignment be make prior to you arrival .the front desk clerk do not have the authority to change you room at check in .if you want to change room , speak to the manager and most likely you will get a new room assignment the follow day.room : ours be on the pool side # 4263 .i believe that 4 stand for the building , 2 stand for third floor and 63 be the actual room number .although it be a 4 story building , when you get into the elevator you can see that ground floor be zero so go figure !the higher the room number , the closer you will be to the beach .odd number be poolside , even number room look onto the bavaro bungalow and caribbean street .the building themselves , dominicana and punta cana be nearly identical and face each other .the landscaping at these resort be well above average .there be maze like pathway and garden between the two building that lead to the pool and lobby.the most striking thing be the interior space within the building itself .the room be all situate around a fabulous inner atrium with fountain , lush palm tree , reflect water garden and hang plant .the sound of the run water within this space eliminate the usual hallway noise , voice and door banging .the room itself be somewhat of a disappointment .although it be quite large , with a very private balcony and great partial ocean/pool view , the paint and fabric be in sad shape .not terrible , but not great .the bathroom be nice , smallish tub , large mirror , hair dryer , stone tile .housekeeper do a excellent job .towel sculpture and fresh flower be provide each day .-lrb- no coffee maker or umbrella in room -rrb- .a covered tile walkway on the bavaro side of the building allow you to walk all the way to the lobby and restaraunt , very nice if it rain .we also see several people in wheel chair , so it appear to be fairly handicapped accessible .there be no actual oceanfront room that we could see , and the way the main building be lay out , no one be at a real disadvantage location wise except for the suite .they be the farthest from beach and pool , and do not look much different from the standard room , perhaps fresher paint.beach and pool : great pool but in most area the water be over 5 foot deep , shallow part be limit , something to be aware of with young child .there be a small kiddie pool , water temp be nice and warm .chair under palapa be take by 7:30 am , so plan accordingly .the beach be fantastic - the water be warm with a fairly calm surf and sandy bottom .chair under palapa seem impossible to get , but plenty of extra chair in the sun .several other resort side by side , so lot of people walk along the beach.bars : there be about 5 bar scatterd throughout the dominicana side .while at the pool we discover a small corner bar that be never crowd on the punta cana side .this be also where you will find the best lunch - rotisserie chicken , fish , roast pork , beef and soft serve ice cream for the kid .at night this be the steak restaraunt .bartender seem to be very conservative while pour .unless you specifically ask , you be give just a smidge of alcohol .most drink be a very sweet premixture with a tiny amount of alcohol already in it - if you ask for more they sort of roll they eye at you .tip help .presidente beer be on tap and cold , so that be o.k. the lobby bar in the evening be much nicer.food : overall pretty typical .- other reviewer have give good description .one thing that set the iberostar apart from other dominican resort be the quality of they meat .it be far better than any other dominican resort we have be to .vegetarian might have a bit of a challenge , but they do have pasta at the buffet .a la carte 's ... nothing great , the appetizer at the chinese be a favorite .not too much difficulty get reservation .buffet be never crowd , dine room be pretty , plenty of table .red and white wine pour at dinner .the wine be also better than other dominican resort we have be to .entertainment : the casino be small but nice , most in we group come out ahead .we do not watch much of the show , but we six year old find a giant , overweight , sleepy chicken that hang out near the stage bar each night , to be he entertainment .check out/departure : the apple desk give we a 10:20 be pick up time for a 12:20 pm flight .we think that be cut it a bit close ... but we trust they judgement ... at 9:00 be we get a call from the front desk that the bus be wait for we !!the person who arrange the time the day before have mess up.near panic-husband and son be at the pool for a final swim .emmanual , the apple rep be fantastic .after several animated phone call on he part , and a quite bit of shout in spanish to whoever be on the other end , we be finally send a private taxi .we watch he pay the driver with he own money.overall a great vacation !feel free to email ."

only post this comment so other people wont overlook these bad review and make the same mistake i do .i go to dream punta cana on mon june 30th , 2008 with my boyfriend .we be suppose to stay until mon july 7th but there be too many thing go wrong to over look and just have fun .im so angry with liberty travel -lrb- brooklyn , n.y. king highway travel agent inna , manager , rise -rrb- because they speak very highly of dream punta cana and do very little to make up for the problem we have .i will never book a trip with they again .my flight be delay go to punta cana , but that happen when you travel .then we arrive in the domincan rep. airport .very unorgainized and hot .no air conditioner anywhere in this place .they only use fan .then we head to we tour bus pick out by liberty travel and wait for all the passenger to find they smash luggage and board the bus ..they tell we it be a hour long trip to the resort .but for the small amount of mile you be travel if they acutally build road for you to drive on , it would only take 15 -20 min .my trip to the resort take 3 hour b/c we bus break down .it be very scary drive through break , dirt road with poor people sit on the side of they .some local people walk along the road with huge knife in they hand .you dont feel safe at all .anything could have happen .the next bus come to pick we up and finish the trip .the 2nd driver drive very reckless hit tree and fence and almost other vehicle .we get a flat tire on the 2nd bus and we roll slowly the remainder of the way .when we arrive at dream we find out that the dream package we be suppose to have wasnt set up .that be the travel agent fault .but they say we would get we extra stuff include in the package .then they bring we to we honeymoon suite in building 8 .there be nothing special in it like we concierge say he would take care of .like everyone else complain the room be so hot .the air conditioner be control so they cant be too cold or strong enough .i also notice little ant on the sink and vanity .i call to complain .right away someone come to fix the air condiitioner .i watch a man take apart the ceiling and drop it on the floor .i guess he restart it or do something to make it cooler and a little stronger .then he put the ceiling back together .right there i know how this trip be go to be .this be not a five star resort .more like a 2 star .the air be better but not like you have it at home or any other 5 star resort .they do give I the champagne and fruit basket , robe , etc later on but at that point i wasnt feeling happy to celebrate .i make my mom call the travel agent for I and explain what happend b/c the phone in the room be expensive .inna the travel agent do nothing say i be a liar , what package ?, its not she fault and i guess never tell the manager of liberty to call I .i try to make the best of it wait for the manager to call I .the pool be full of kid jump n scream everywhere .if you want a chair by the pool , wake up at 7am and put you towel out to save they .dont even think about a float mat for the pool , there be only 20 for the whole resort .you have to fight people for they when they be not use they .they just hide they under they chair .the beach be full of seaweed and rock .not like the picture they show .that be what i book my trip for a beautiful beach .the food be terrible .im from ny we have some of the best resturant in the world and this not what we expect for a 5 star hotel .long wait time to eat .very under staff .food make I sick .we eat at the french resturant and we order cheese cake and chocolate mousse .the cheese cake look like a english muffin and the mousse taste like cardboard .the buffet for breakfast in the world cafe be ok but make I sick too .and no i never drink the water .room service be just scary .id rather have mcdonald .that night we have dinner on the beach in pitch darkness and that be the only somewhat edible food we have .by the third night the ant problem be bad .the ant have go everywhere .they be crawl out of my clothes that be in the closet , on the night stand and phone when i pick it up to complain .we be disgust .it be too late to switch resort so we change room , at 12:00 am .now we be in honeymoon suite , building 7 which be the same .very hot and have the same ant or whatever bug they be .this room didnt even have a remote .we just go to bed with the smell of bug spray and wait for morning .the next morning i get the manager of liberty travel on the phone .i tell she we either want to come home or switch resort .i mention the excellence which be 10 min away .i check we out .we get in a cab and go to excellence resort .my travel agent didnt want to pay to ugrade I there even after everthe i go through b/c of where they send I .the concierge see i be very upset and give I a excellence club suite without the perk of have the card but atleast it be something .the beach be beautiful here .the staff be very nice , speak english and always try to make you have fun.the food and drink be much better here .the spa wasnt great though , very hot no air conditioner .the place over all more for couple , no kid .there be still a few ant i saw in the sink only but i think this problem be just everywhere in the dominican rep. they be in the spa , lobby , airport everywhere .my bf get very sick the last 2 day of the trip .he stomach be really bad .i give he immodium but he couldnt leave the room .he be even sick for a few day when we get back home and have to call out sick from work .i have stay at excellence in rivera maya , mexico and it be great .not one problem .so i think it be just dom .rep. punta cana .i will never ever go back there .i will also never stay at a dream resort anywhere in the world .my trip cost I 3,500 , plus a huge phone bill for turn on long distance for my cell phone so i could call home and the travel agent , phone card do not work there .$ 15.00 on another cab ride to switch hotel , $ 20.00 just to enter punta cana that no one tell you about , and a new luggage b/c i feel like the one i take be infested with ant and i dont want it in my house .i also have to dry clean and wash every item clothing i bring b/c of the fear of bug .dry cleaning cost I over $ 100 on thing i have clean to wear there , that i didnt even put on .that be too much money too spend to go to a third world counrty .its too much of a hassle for a vacation that suppose to be a 5 star resort .more like a african safari , not a luxury vacation .i have never have anything like this happen to I .my advice , dont go to punta cana , or if you do pay with you amex card so you can try and get you money back ."

0,0,0,-1,2,-1,2,-1,very disappointed in room !i could not believe the room we have for almost $ 300.00 a night .it be the type of room i would expect at a budget motel .it be small and definitely nothing special about it .i guess the price be so high because the hotel be locate on the beach which be a definite plus .the food be very expensive .we only eat at the hotel the first night due to the price .the staff be nice .
0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,"most holiday inn express be better than this holiday inn i always hit the gym for a workout even during business travel , so i always pay attention to the gym/fitness amenity and consider it a important factor when i book my hotel .the hotel website 's picture show the fitness room have a variety of equipment , include a multi-station weight machine .my experience be completely the opposite.don ' t let the million-dollar lobby fool ya , the room be horrible .they be date and dirty , nothing like the lobby .i be assign to a room where the bed be not make , the garbage can be still full and only the bathroom seem to be clean .after i bring this to the staff 's attention , the reluctantly give I a different room .this one be unvacuumed and have colorful peanut mm all over the place .the bathroom amenity be so cheap , the item be from different collection , and nothing match .shampoo from one brand , lotion from another , and soap from yet a third source that do not even have holiday inn logo.the gym be also old and dated .it do not have the multi-station equipment as picture and barely have a couple of half broken threadmill and a few unpaired free-weight .except the lobby area , the rest of the hotel give I a yucky unclean feeling .this be a wyndham at one point , but this holiday inn be soo cheap , they never bother to replace some signage with wyndham 's name .instead , they use a black marker to black out wyndham 's name .how tacky.overall , this be definitely not what i expect from a holiday inn , i have way better experience at holiday inn express or low-end place like comfort inn and etc. ."

2,2,1,-1,2,-1,1,-1,"do as little or as much as you want my husband and i actually just get back at 2am this morning from we vacation to the iberostar dom .i be addict to this site so i could not wait to get back and write my review .we take this trip from may 6-13 for we 5 year anniversary .we have be to the couple negril , the melia in cozumel and now this be we 3rd all inclusive , and naturally you compare the resort to eachother .we book we vacation thru we airway vacation -lrb- a subsidiary of funjet vacation -rrb- .they make everything so easy .once we get to the airport , of course you pretty much get stop by a hear of airport bellman i guess you could call they , so pretty much you have no choice but to give they you luggage to take you to you transfer .the ride to the hotel be like a game of dodgem car at the amusement park .it be about a 30-35 minute ride .check in at the hotel be easy .we end up in one of the junior suite without even ask , which be fine , but we end up in a room with 2 double bed .which be fine , we do not need to have we room change .its true , the bed be not very comfortable and the pillow be rather flat .i have 2 pillow already on the bed and then i just use one of the decoration pillow from the couch and that work fine .the air conditioning really do not get that cold , the room always have a damp feel to it .later on i find out that the light , fan , tv , and air conditioning be on a motion sensor so they turn off when you be not in the room and then they turn on again when it sens you enter the room .the air conditioning switch be on the headboard .thanks to some of the other review , i know right where to look !!also the slide door must be completely shut for the air to work .if that door be keep open , the air will not go on .so check you door sometimes the maid do not always make sure they be close .overall i would rate the room average , it be not as nice as some of the other resort we have be to but it serve the purpose for the amount of time we spend in there.we spend most of we day at thepunta cana side of the pool .we usually head down to the pool about 10 am and never have a problem get a chair .you almost have to save you chair for the day , since you be not go to carry you beach bag and towel with you wherever you go .the pool be always really refreshing , especially since the sun be really intense in the dr !!we love just sit in the wade part of the pool sip blue hawai -lrb- yummy if you like coconut drink -rrb- and margarita !!yes there be a bar in the steakhouse , which be the closest to the area that we be sit , and they seem to always give we the larger cup and the bartender be always the friendliest .its kind of a hidden treasure .i would definately recommend the marinarium excursion where you snorkel with the nurse shark and the sting ray , that be so much fun sharky and the crew be so awesome !!!... the best part be when they bring out the blender and make fresh coco loco right there on the catamaran !!!!!they be constantly walk around offer you fresh fruit , drink , water , and sandwich !then the last part of the trip be when they take you to the natural pool where the caribbean sea meet the atlantic ocean .the water be only waist deep and they bring you drink right there .they really make the trip what it be !worth every penny!i do not know how people can go to this resort and complain about the food .i think the food be wonderful !!!from the buffet to the al a carte ... everything be so good !!there be pretty much something for everyone .if you can not find a entree you like , then make a sandwich , there be always lunch meat and fixing , and ton of fresh bread .you have to go with a open mind , the food be most likely go to taste a little different than it do back home ... remember you be not eat at mcdonald !i will repeat the food be wonderful!the show be pretty entertaining ... and the cocktail waitress always make sure you have pleantly to drink , especially if you give they a few dollar .the entertainment staff work really hard and be always try to get people involve in the many many activity they have go on ... which we always decline since all we want to do be lay in the sun and do absolutely nothing!all in all we enjoy we vacation ... i do not regret stay at the iberostar at all .may be the start of rainy season in the dr so there be 1 day when it rain all day and then there be 2 other day when it rain for a few hour in the afternoon .the grounds be beautiful , very well keep , the animal that live on the resort be fun to see ... especially the peacock that would wake we up every morning cackeling as he be visit we on we balcony .i would not stay at this resort again only for the fact that we like to go different place every time we travel.we do not wait in a long line at all at the airport for we we airway flight , i guess the length of the line depend on which airline you use .everything seem to flow just fine .just keep in mind that everything be out in the open so it get hot when you be sit there wait for you flight.oh yes , the resort be mainly european so there be alot of topless lady and lot and lot of speedo .but that be entertaining in itself.enjoy you trip and relax !"

0,1,2,-1,2,-1,0,-1,"the real truth about this resort ... i just reurn from my vacation at club golden bahia principe .we be there from july 23-31 ,2005 .prior to leave , i have read many review both good and bad but i decide to go with a open mind and enjoy my vacation and time away with my husband and teenage daughter .we buy a package with air transat .it be a overnight flight so we know that this would be tough .we leave montreal at 11 p.m. arrive in p.c. at 3 a.m. it be wonderful have the check-in do for we as we arrive , this way we be bring by trolley straight to we beautiful room and go straight to sleep .here be my honest take on this resort !food : as long as you stick to the indoor buffet , you be safe !the a la carte restaurant have great ambiance but the food be all the same .i must add that it be not that the food be bad anywhere , it be just that the meat , fish , flour , water , be not the same as we be use to .they do not use fresh herb or spice in they food just a lot of salt and some pepper .in term of the food , i truely believe that they want to please all the guest but that they do not pretend to be american , canadian , or british or other .this hotel chain be spanish own and it cater to those taste .we do not eat at the outdoor restaurant because those that do get sick .as previously mention in other review , the food be often leave out in temperature rise above 90 f , and although they try to maintain the refridgeration -lrb- ice keep ketchup , mayo , and coldcut cool -rrb- it be almost impossible .room : the room be beautiful and spacious .keep clean and tidy .it be important to tip the maid !on the 1 day that we forget , we have no towel or water bottle .communication : since we speak french and english , communicate with the staff be not that much of a problem but we do see a older couple from new england have a very diificult time .the woman have come to activate she room key -lrb- a card with a strip -rrb- that have stop work .they do so immediately , but they neglect to tell she that she would need to change all the key from the people in she party .she have to come back a hour later in 90f heat to change she husband key .employee : this be where we have a problem .i have be to at least 10 all-inclusive resort and this be the first one where the staff seem more unhappy than not .again , perhaps this be just I not understand a cultural difference but i never feel that there be a genuine happiness there .in march we go to a a.i in cuba and even though the people there live with such political / financial resriction , we still feel like we be 1 -rrb- understand and 2 -rrb- respect .air transat : there be absolutely no communication between this air line , and this hotel .we have amy as we air transit tour operator .she explain all the procedure , rule , schedule , excursion , etc. .she give she cell # in case of emergency .when i need to call she about info regard we departure , they tell I she be no longer there and genus be take over.very important info for people come from montreal : we travel agent here in montreal tell we that check-out at the hotel be at noon but since we flight leave at 4 a.m , the hotel allow for a late check-out .not !until we get the right info about this , we have waste we whole last day organize we departure .the tour operator -lrb- genus -rrb- at air transit do not herself know the hotel policy because they change from person to person .this be the where as a pay customer you get really turn off !the hotel tell we that check out be at noon .if we want we room until 6 p.m. we can have it at 10 dollar u.s. if we choose to stay after 6 then it be 99.00 u.s. per person .$ 300:00 in we case .if we choose to check out at noon then they will keep we luggage safe and we can shower in they public shower .please note that the hotel public area be not air conditioned and it be still over 90 and humid in the evening .we choose to stay at $ 10 per hour but we lose that whole last day wait for someone to tell we if we could have another room since ours have someone come to it at 3 p.m. check out be at noon but they do not move we til 1:35 .they have tell we to be there before 8 a.m check out day .when we get there the club golden rep donny be the only person who could get we another room and he be in at 9 a.m. we wait and wait .he tell we to back to we room and he would change we room by 12 .in the end , they want to charge we for 6 hour but they do not give we a room until 1.30 .when we explain that we have waste the whole day wait for donny to get we a room and that it be not 6 hour they make we feel like we be be cheap .i be still not sure if this be a problem with air transat or the hotel but it be terribly plan .i would have prefer to pay for a extra day here in canadian $ before i leave .all in all , i would not go back to this resort .i do not feel like they value my business at all .i pay $ 5000.00 for 3 of we to go and i feel i deserve to be treat with more respect !* as a side note , we take some soda bottle from we hotel fridge to take with we to the airport since we be leave the hotel at 1 a.m. and we be only fly at 4 a.m. we anticipate that the store in the airport would be close at that hour .we leave these soda bottle with we luggage in a plastic bag in what we be tell be the guest service safety room .-lrb- unlock room -rrb- when we go to get we luggage at 1 a.m. the door man who be supposs to be watch this room be drink we 7 up and coke , and water bottle .also , my daughter 's valise be open but nothing be take .a word of advise , bring lock for you luggage !"

1,1,0,2,2,2,2,0,"intercontinental century city - it be all about the detail we recently stay 5 night at the century city intercontinental hotel in november of 2007 .we book we stay with hotwire and pay $ 219/night ... it be a little expensive compare to what other reviewer pay , but we basically book it within a month , so it be the cheapest i could find in the beverly hills/century city area.i be really excite to stay here , but mostly because i have not be on vacation for a long time .after book with hotwire , i call the hotel and put in a request with reservation for a nice room with a king bed and a nice view - plus , we have a flat screen tv , which be a nice touch .fortunately for we , when we arrive , they have honor we request , which be really nice !we stay in 1512 and have a great view since it be a corner unit.overall , i would say that this hotel be very nice - definitely a 3 to 3.5 star hotel .the detail be what bring down its rating in my book -lrb- see the end of my review for more -rrb- .it be obviously more suit to the business traveler , but be centrally located near good shopping - you have get venice beach to the west and west hollywood to the east .there be a free concierge car service to rodeo drive in the heart of beverly hill , which be a nice touch - however , they warn you that they will not go beyond rodeo drive and the hour be not conducive to late night .the lobby be really nice and the 24 hour exercise facility be excellent .make sure to go to the spa and ask for a locker and you will have access to the spa 's nice shower area .the locker room close at 11 pm , but the spa close at 9 pm .if you want to use the locker room from 9-11 pm , make sure to go to concierge and ask for a key there.a lot of reviewer be shock at the price of room service and the item in the minus fridge , but seriously , you be stay at a 4 star hotel within 2 mile of beverly hill , what do you expect ?i would not be stupid enough to order room service or grab anything out of the fridge .instead , head to the century city westfield mall , about a mile away and go to the grocery store , gelson 's , and pick up some snack there .although the fridge be seal , you can also chill you drink use the ice basket provide .one nice touch be that they provide you with free fijus water - we get 3 each time they clean the room .note , they do a general cleaning in the morning and a turn down service at night , so they will knock on you door before noon and probably around 8 or 9 pm .the turndown service be also really nice touch .one thing about the cleaning service : we stay for 5 night at the hotel and we notice a drop off in the quality of the cleaning towards the end of we stay - for instance , not all the towel be replenish and we no longer receive 3 bottle of fijus , but only 2 .again , head to the century city mall for most of you dining need as it be not only a gorgeous outdoor mall , but the food be very fresh and there be a lot of selection at the food court and other dining establishments.details : although we guest room -lrb- 1512 -rrb- be impressive at first glance , there be some issue i observe that bring down my overall impression at the intercontinental century city .first of all , the heating and a/c unit be very loud , but function very well .secondly , the price of wireless internet access be exorbitant -lrb- nearly $ 10/day ! -rrb-.a hotel of this caliber should have free wireless access , especially consider the amount of business client at the hotel .note : you can go to the business center -lrb- not the greatest at all -rrb- and also pay for internet access -rrb- , but you can also go to a little cubby near the check in desk ... there be a tiny claustrophobic space where they have a free internet terminal .sometimes people stand in a line wait to use it , so just be aware of that.thirdly , there be no in-room mirror -lrb- they be only in the bathroom -rrb- , so it be inconvenient get dress before we leave we room .fourthly , the cost of mandatory valet parking be ridiculous .although i understand that the custom in la be pay parking -lrb- a lot of place , such as the westfield mall offer the first 1.5 to 3 hour free -rrb- , $ 30 a day be quite high - however , the valet service be excellent , so it feel like you be get what you pay for .lastly , the bathroom also look impressive upon first glance ... however , upon closer inspection , i be shock at the lack of attention to detail .for instance , the bathroom countertop be not properly attach to the wall , so where it connected , instead of a waterproof seal , the wallpaper extend onto the countertop to cover up the absence of any waterproof seal .finally , although the separate shower be a nice touch , the tiling in the shower be a little uneven .again , these be small detail , but in a top tier hotel , it be the detail that count.i think overall , i would rate this hotel a 3.5 .have it not be for the detail , i would have definitely say a 4 , or possibly a 4.25 .but due to the lack of attention to detail , i would overall rate this as a 3.5 ."

2,1,2,-1,2,-1,2,-1,"love the hhv my husband , 2 child -lrb- 7 3 -rrb- , and i stay here in may , 2005 for 2 week in the alli tower .we love the resort and the island as well .the resort be large and impose but we like that because there be a lot of shop and amenity and you could blend in and not really be bother .room : it be true what they say , if you can afford the alli tower stay there .we do and it be well worth the extra money .the room have a large -lrb- about 32 -rrb- flat panel lcd tv in every room , there be even a mini tv in the bathroom .the bed be heavenly , with thick duvet and large comfy down pillow .there be a separate dressing/makeup area that be outside the bathroom area with a large vanity , sink and mirror , so two people could be get ready at the same time .the only down side to the room be they be look a little worn .in one corner the wallpaper be peel , there be scuff mark by the door nothing major but over all a little lack lustre .they be in the process of renovate all room in the alli tower right now -lrb- accord to thier website -rrb- and they be schedule to be finish by feb 2006 .another thing that bother I about the room be the housekeeping .they do a fine job clean the room but we have 4 people in the room .when we ask to have we towel change most time they only give we 3 bath towel so someone would have to use a just use wet towel .after 2 kid spend a day at the beach yuck !also , they put chocolate on the pillow during turndown service .i always look forward to retire to the room at night and have that little treat , but when you have 2 child and they only give you 2 chocolate the kid get the chocolate and the parent get nothing .i would ask for 4 chocolate and 4 bath towel , sometimes they would leave they for we , most time not .it become a real pain call housekeeping for a extra bath towel .it be the little thing that make service outstanding.alli tower in general : overall the alli tower be great .the front desk service be quite good .a couple time when we review we account on the tv we find a couple of discrepancy in we account , but they be take care of immediately .the concierge be quite knowledgable and help we many time .we love the hors d'oeuvre upstairs by the pool , they have quite a good selection .we be not expect much when we go on we first night and be very pleasantly surprised .they have a good selection of fruit and veggy with dip , and hot food such as chicken skewer as well .it be something that we look forward too , every evening we would buy a drink -lrb- lava flow be really good and all drink be top with orchid -rrb- and have hors d'oeuvre while we watch the hula show down by the pool or just stare out over the ocean .the pool at the alli tower be just for the guest in that tower .it be open later -lrb- till 8pm -rrb- than the super pool so it be nice for a evening swim and there be a hot tub in one corner that overlook the ocean .one night the 4 of we sit up in the hot tub , no one else be there and we watch fire eater put on a show down on the beach .it be pure heaven.the resort : the resort be a very beautiful place .the garden and the fish pond be incredible .the penguin and flamingo keep the kid interested .the super pool be quite cold and you have to be there very early to get a chair .i also do not like the idea that we have to pay through the nose for beach chair and umbrella .i think it be $ 20/umbrella and $ 20/chair , or something like that per day .it should not cost $ 100 to get beach chair at the resort .the food on the resort be good , we especially like the breakfast buffet at the rainbow lanai .get there early though or you will have to wait for a table , everyone else like the breakfast there too .another good place to eat be round table pizza , the pizza be excellent and quite cheap .$ 25.00 get you a large pizza smother in topping , try the hawaiian , no one do it better .when we arrive in we cab from the airport we be remove we luggage and get yell at for the cab be in the way even though i do not feel that he be .i also want to know why we be get ask , no , yell at to move we cab , perhaps some guest might need to be check in at the resort ?the resort can be a spendy place but if you carefully prepare and do not get too lure in by the shop you can keep you cost down .another thing , they do cater to the japanese tourist there .they have these special open air tram that we try to get on once but be tell they be private .do not understand that since it be stop at the bus stop and it be full of japanese tourist .most thing be within walk distance anyway .downtown be within walk distance , it be about a 10 minute walk , try go along the beach boardwalk it be a nice walk .also ala moana mall be a close walk , about 10 min in the opposite direction .if you want do a lot of shopping that be the place to go.overall : the whole island be incredibly beautiful , and the resort match it .it be like they try to make the resort rival the beauty of the island .we rent a car for 8 day and explore every coast and every nook and cranny of the island .thing that we really like be pearl harbour , the polynesian cultural center , sea life park , and if you get a chance drive to the north shore .there be not alot to do on the north shore but it capture the essence of hawaii .you can sit on beautiful beach and watch the surfer , it be what i envision old oahu to be like .also go to matsumoto on the north shore for shave ice , its a nice treat .also try duke at the outrigger reef hotel , it be a waikiki icon .all in all love the resort , love the island , want to go back and will go back , hopefully very soon ."

2,1,2,-1,2,-1,1,-1,"wonderful beach resort - not for snorkele first thing first , if you plan on stay at the new riu palace be sure you flight be into punta cana .ours be but then in typical american airline fashion be cancel , and we be divert into san domingo .take it from someone who make the trip , all 3 hour of it at 12:30 be you do not want to .if you have to travel during the day the trip could easily take 4 hour or more depend on traffic .there be no traffic during we ride .there be highway for about the first 70km or so and then you get onto blacktop 2 lane road with plenty of pothole , speed bump and dip , and obstacle galore .we driver manage to run over not 1 , but 2 dog during we sojourn .thankfully he do not add any human to that tally , but i think that be pure luck .enough say about that , remember land in punta cana .first of all let I say that the facility itself be gorgeous !that be say there be some room for improvement in the managing of the facility and the offer amenity .i will start by give you the con and then the positive .riu bill this as a five -lrb- 5 -rrb- star resort , which the structure itself be .however , we book we 8 day stay directly with riu reservation , almost 3 month prior to the facility opening .when we make the reservation we ask for a ocean view , with a king size bed .upon arrive in san juan , earlier on the day of we arrival we contact the hotel manager on duty to let they know we would be delay arrive there and to reconfirm we room requirement .no problem .when we finally arrive at the hotel at 3:30 am there be no bellman etc. -lrb- remember now this be suppose to be a five star facility -rrb- we have to bring in we own luggage from the cab and find a couple of people at the main desk .we introduce ourselves and check in .because we make we own reservation , -lrb- and to be honest i be not sure about they policy if you book through a tour agency -rrb- we have to prepay for we entire stay when we check in .they say it be company policy as they have be stiff by people in the past , they have stay and upon check out they card be deny etc. so be forewarn you will be require to prepay for you entire stay when you check in .after check in they do track down someone to see we to we room along with we luggage .when we arrive at the room they assign we to it be a side garden view with two double bed shove together , not the ocean view with the king size bed .we relay we displeasure to the bellman who contact the front desk .when he finish the conversation we be tell that the room we be suppose to be in be not clean and they be sorry and would move we to a room like we have request in the morning .-lrb- now realize they have a additional 8 hour prior to we arrival to make the room ready after we have contact they in san juan -rrb- .the night manager promise we a particular room , so we go and check it out from the outside -lrb- it have a do not disturb sign hanging on the door -rrb- we say that the room would be acceptable and turn in for the night in the room originally assign to we .-lrb- note -rrb- the ac in this room work great !.lastly we ask the bellman about room service , since we have not eat in at least 14 hour and be inform that the hotel have no room service whatsoever .if we be hungry though they do provide ready to eat snack in the sport bar which be open 24 hour a day .we just go to bed .-lrb- we do find out later however that you could get you choice of 3 different style of breakfast deliver to you room , although we never try it -rrb- .the next day we awake , go down have breakfast , check out we surroundings a bit and then go to the front desk to arrange we move to the promise room .the day manager say that the promise move would not be possible as the room the night manager have promise we be a more expensive room .but he would move we to a room at the other end of the same hall face the ocean .the room be exactly the same , so what give ?the one he offer be on one corner of the building , and the promise room be on the other corner .any way we take the room after a inspection to make sure that the new room do indeed meet we criterion .we also end up move we own luggage to this new room after wait almost 45 minute for the promise bellman who never show up .the new room be beautiful , and be everything that we expect .the ocean view be still questionable though , you have to look over the roof of the health club/spa to see it , in fact if you look at the facility , the design be somewhat poor in that the lower level of room on the end of both wing of the hotel , the one that should be all ocean view , be both obstruct by support building .one be the spa , and on the other side , one of the restaurant obstruct the view .with so few room on the end of the building you would have think they would have protect the premium view from these suite , but do not .any way , back to we room , additionally the air conditioner be not keep the room cool .we go down to the front desk , and speak with the manager directly about the ac and he assure we he would send someone right up to fix it .so we return to we room to finally unpack and settle in for the week .after and hour the mechanic have still not show up to address the problem and another call be make .eventually a couple of maintenance people show up with a hose and a ladder , and mess around for about 30 minute with the unit in the ceiling and then leave .at any rate they have make no difference in the operation of the unit which just barely manage to keep the room at about 80 - 85 degree .this ordeal eat up we entire morning of we second day there .we do not get out of the room until after 1:00 pm with have to deal with all of this .up until the time we leave the air conditioning issue be never resolve .it be a daily call after hot sticky night , with promise of repair make by the manager , only to return that evening to the same condition .we main desire on vacation be to find resort that provide both the 5 star amenity that we want with great snorkeling .we be both diver and take we own gear but prefer to snorkel off the beach and take the occasional tour .we both be very confident in we ability of 20 + year each and will sometimes snorkel from the beach 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile out depend on the condition .the punta cana palace while provide a somewhat five star facility do not have the snorkeling that we and most likely other will desire .the swim area which we usually venture out of very quickly , be relatively small and we be drive back in by people in watercraft each time we venture outside this area .the boat traffic be just terrible between shuttle diver from place to place , people ride the banana tube , and parasailing there be a constant tumult of boat traffic .one of the diver at the dive shop -lrb- book dive tour -rrb- say that if we really want good snorkeling we would need to sign up for one of the day long tour , which in the end consist of about 3 to 4 hour of good snorkeling and 6 to 7 hour of transportation on a bus boat etc. we try it and find that the small amount of snorkele time be not worth the majority of the day be spend on travel which start at 6:30 am and end at 7:00 pm .the punta cana palace in addition to a beautiful facility , also have some really good dining .the 5 specialty restaurant in particular be first class both in food and service .the buffet also offer a abundance and variety of great food .the specialty restaurant be include in the all inclusive but you have to make reservation each morning at 10:00 be for the restaurant of you choice .so if you be not there early you will miss out .there be two seating each night one at 6:30 pm the other at 9:00 pm .seating be limit to about 30 table or less per restaurant or so it look .we end up cut we stay there short by 4 day due to the air conditioning issue , but mostly due to the snorkeling availability .we end up at the sunscape casa del mar in la romana .i will write a review of we stay there as well .get the 4 day refund be a hassle too , if you will recall we have to prepay for the entire stay upon arrival .all in all the facility be beautiful and the food be great .as for the five star rating , if you can live with the placate mediocre management , limited service time for some of the staff -lrb- such as bellman -rrb- , lack of room service , and a concierge that will not or can not arrange airport pick up or delivery among other thing , then you will thoroughly enjoy this facility .lastly -lrb- and i know this be really be picky -rrb- but for a five star facility i use a lot of paper napkin outside of the cloth one at the specialty restaurant .if you want to be a five star facility then be one , five star begin with service and end with the smallest of detail .if you want the five star service that go with the facility then you might want to pass on this one for now , be a new hotel they may eventually get they act together .my rating of above average be base on the building itself , the quality of the food and the friendliness of the support staff other than those behind the front desk , who i will sadly never see again .i can not say enough about the beauty of this facility , but as they say beauty be only skin deep ."

the langham patrolman .this guy in the lobby who make it he job to see if anybody in the lobby be misbehave .im serious , i think this be really he job .i have to wait in the lobby since room wasnt ready , so i go to the mall and get myself a coffee and look around .i return to hotel and it be still too early , so i just sit there in one of the chair which have a table beside it .i put my coffee on the table and start search for something in my bag .then ... .mr langham police come and say , sorry , but you arent allow to put down you coffee at the table .that be really bizarre ... i think that be what table be for !!!so i ask why ?and he say with a really apologetic face , i really dont know but those be the rule .sheeesh , if that be he job and he have to do it everyday , he might as well know why , right ??ok that be not a isolate case .on a separate occasion , sit in the lobby again , this guy be reprimand for sit on the arm part of the chair , since there werent enough chair .and on another occasion , there be this lady beside I who be sort of fill she nail .now this be really weird , file you nail in public .but apparently , she break she nail , so it be sort of necessary at that time .and of course langham patrol guy come and tell she that filing be not allow .and she say , but i break my nail , and he say , can i see ??so bizarre .this lobby police thing be really a first for I , and its really weird .they make you uncomfortableon you own holiday.-i have to agree with the other guy that the check-in service be not quite good .first off you be welcome at street level by these girl in hot pink outfit , and pink hat .i be not sure if i could blame my mood upon arrival , but it be just a tad annoy that they try to make chit chat which i find a little bit contrived , like it be all a part of a script or something .go back to check-in , we arrive almost noon time , so this could be the reason that the queue feel like a bank queue , seriously .i mean standing in line isnt exactly jolly when you have have just come from a flight .there be probably three lane and in each lane there be about three person in line .then when it be my turn to check in , the lady in the unapollogetically tell I that we have to wait until two pm to get the room .it wasnt she fault really that check in time be really at 2 , but it didnt help either that she have a look that feel like she just want to get I over with and get to the next person in line.-room size : tiny .the size be similar to european style hotel room .for hong kong standard this be really small .no need for a huge plasma tv really , as the bed be close to the wall in front .room have 2 single bed .there be really no option to get 2 double bed in room since they dont have any.all in all , market place-like check-in experience plus langham police guy really ruin it for I .i be not sure this be a five star hotel .probably a four star yes .if you feel the need to stay in mongkok or have business there , then this be probably the best option there be .otherwise , there be so many other option in hk .by the way , another reviewer mention he pay usd95 per room per night .at this price , i think its worth it .in the end , i think the level of enjoyment come relative to price pay , so since i pay more here , and couldve pay less at similar level , better situate hotel , my satisfaction level be only at 80 % level ."

very persistent - this be not acceptable and i inform max -lrb- we signature rep at the resort -rrb- of this problem .overall i would give this resort a 2 out of 5 base on we experience .again , we have be to several all inclusive resort and never complain once and have a fantastic time .to pay over $ 4200 for two people plus spend money on top of that , you be better off stay at another hotel and not take the chance at this one .it be funny that signature vacation will not recommend certain excursion off the resort as they be not safe or worth the money in they opinion , but they still will list and recommend this resort in they travel brochure .i be extremely displeased with this trip and file a report with signature vacation .it be my belief that signature should pull this resort from they package ."

always available .happy hour have cheaply price drink at the pool bar which be nice .david the bartender make great drink , but need more help during happy hour which get very busy .they block off the entrance to beach in the evening time which seem strange , but there be access another way it seems.they be currently do contruction on the other side of the street which would be the location of the cafe and the main lobby of the hotel .the man at the front desk claim that all of they room have be renovate which seem to be true .hopefully in a year all the contruction will be do and everything will be work properly and open .if not other hotel down the street would be a option for sure next time !puerto rico be absolutely beautiful and can not wait to come back again !!!"

$ 25 per person -lrb- if you work out -rrb- , it鈥檚 worth it for the savings on breakfast and workout facility .the evening hors d oeuvre be ok , they always have a desert cake or pie , two app , fresh veggy and dip , assorted cheese , and mixed nut .plus , the drink aren鈥檛 necessarily cheaper , but pour a lot harder in the club room.as far as the hotel room on the club floor go , they鈥檙e ok , nothing really exceptional that separate they from the rest of the hotel .mostly you鈥檒l feel like you walk into a polo ad , the only real difference be that you get bottled water for free , access to the lounge , a more upscale -lrb- note i do not say larger -rrb- bathroom , and most importantly free access to the workout/pool facility -lrb- a $ 10 per person per day value -rrb- .the rest of the hotel be nice , if you鈥檙e expect the ritz , don鈥檛 , you鈥檙e not pay ritz price .if you want the ritz , stay at the ritz .this be a very nice sheraton by nationwide sheraton standard and if you get a good rate here you鈥檒l be happy.with regard to problem , come from someone who spend roughly 150-160 night a year in hotel , this place do a incredible job at take care of the guest .don鈥檛 be fool by any other poster , i鈥檝e stay almost 170 night in this hotel alone , any issue or problem i have be resolve immediately , and if it wasn鈥檛 i be credit bonus point , rate reduction , free room , etc鈥 ften time the problem be resolve immediately and i be still credit bonus point .plain and simple , if you have a problem , don鈥檛 be a jerk , but go down to the front desk and politely ask for the manager , explain the problem , and it will be resolve asap.as with anything in life , there be problem or con , here be a few of mine .first , the cable selection and tv鈥檚 be pretty basic .there be 15-20 channel -lrb- one movie channel -rrb- on a 27 inch tv , not horrible , just not good or great .the bathroom be tiny ; if you need a large bathroom , request a handicapped room .otherwise , they be very small , unless you happen to get one of the two-three room suite at the end of the club room floor .finally , there鈥檚 no wireless connection and the connection be fairly slow by my standards.hope this help ."

where we even have a little glimpse of the ocean .i think the room be lovely .decent size and clean .the bed be very comfortable .the jacuzzi be in the bathroom and nice to have .the shower be a bit unusual and the taller people in we group have some difficulty get the water to stay inside the tub area.the beach be beautiful , as be the garden .the garden in the bavaro side be more in bloom , but all be meticulously care for .the pool be nice and clean 鈥?a little cold but most of we group enjoy the water .the ocean be warmer than the pool .the bar be great , as be the bartender who be very efficient and friendly .unfortunately , the staff in the restaurant be not as pleasant as the bar staff .the service in the restaurant be very poor .in a recently post ta review , it say that the vast majority of the staff we encounter seem less than enthused to be work at the resort .we find the same experience .there be no smile .they seem put out if we request coffee or water .service be slow -lrb- or sometimes nonexistent as i鈥檒l explain later -rrb- .we eat breakfast at the buffet at the palace -lrb- las torre -rrb- , punta cana -lrb- el behique -rrb- , and bavaro -lrb- le catedral -rrb- .we eat dinner at the buffet twice and at two a la carte .several complaint about the buffet .they be not lay out well .many of the breakfast food be make to order create line that take about 15 minute each .that鈥檚 15 minute for egg , then 15 minute for waffle , etc. le catedral be the best where there be some item make to order , but also a tray of pre-prepared egg and pancake , and french toast .too bad we didn鈥檛 discover this buffet until we last breakfast .the quality of the food itself be good , not great .the selection be very good.another complaint : i wonder how the no-reservation system would work for a la carte .not well !we arrive the second night at bamboo -lrb- the asian restaurant -rrb- at 7:30 .no room and a hour wait .a couple have be wait 45 minute when we arrive and be get impatient .if the group of 2 be have trouble , it do not look good for we group of 9 !we then try the mexican restaurant and the spanish restaurant .no luck .so we go to the buffet .the follow night we arrive at bamboo at 6:00 -lrb- it open at 6:30 -rrb- and we do get in .food and service at that restaurant be very good.our biggest problem : we last night we go to el arricife -lrb- seafood steak -rrb- .know to get there early , we arrive at 6:00 and enjoy talk to the other already line up .we be seat at 6:30 .one thing i do not like about the palladium be that they do not cater to group .even in the buffet there be only table for 4 -lrb- 6 at the most -rrb- .they get very upset if you request that two or three table be push together .el arricife be we last dinner and we want to eat together .they actually grant this even though they seem annoy by it .the beverage server come promptly -lrb- and be very good all night -rrb- .the waiter take we order and we wait for we food .we wait 2 hour !i don鈥檛 know what happen .it鈥檚 not that they forget about we 鈥?they bring the 7 year old she food know she would be hungry .when we finally ask the maitre d鈥?for assistance , the waiter have to retake we order and then we wait for more time .we eat the appetizer but be too upset to enjoy the main meal .it be now about 9:00 pm .we eat in 10 minute and skip dessert .the most aggrevating part be that the staff do not seem to care .-lrb- for what it鈥檚 worth , the food that we do get be good -rrb- .just so you know 鈥?we start off we stay at the hotel by tip , but find the service so lack that we only tip occasionally when it be appropriate.one other complaint -lrb- then i鈥檒l get back to the good -rrb- : the resort be very large , as i know it would be .after the first day i have no problem find my way around and enjoy walk between the different section of the hotel .however , we second day have very , very hard rain .between the rain and my father-in-law鈥檚 bad leg , we need to take the train .we wait for over a hour for a train with space .there be a line to get on the train but when it arrive , everyone just shove each other and run to it .it should be more organized.there be a silver line to the train episode .while wait in line for the train , i say something to the family behind I .then the woman ask I where i be from and i ask they the same .when she respond , i realize that she be razel from trip advisor !the hotel be huge .it be such a coincidence to meet .i enjoy meet she and she family who seem like lovely people!more good : the activity 鈥?we have fun with jonathon and all the activity staff do beach aerobic , swim competition , balloon game , etc. they do a good job.they also have nice recreation activity which we do on we own -lrb- in the rain -rrb- .mini-golf , badminton , life-size chess , soccer field , and more .we go to 2 show at night .a 鈥淢r .palladium鈥?competition and the karaoke night .not really my kind of show .i hear the michael jackson show and the star -lrb- impersonator -rrb- show be good but we couldn鈥檛 fit they in.i want to give my honest opinion of the resort because i choose it base on what i read here .however , we have be to other all-inclusive -lrb- sandal , breeze , iberostar bavaro , and palladium mayan riviera -rrb- and find that better service and attitude can be find at all the other .i feel bad complain about certain thing at the hotel when it be obviously a very nice hotel and i feel fortunate to be able to take this kind of vacation .overall we have a nice vacation in a tropical location with we extend family .i hope i be lucky enough to be able to take a trip like this again but i will choose a different hotel ."

0,0,2,1,2,0,0,1,"look be not everything and that be all this place have my husband and i , along with another couple , stay at the paradisus for 4 night from 2/28 -3 / 4 .everything other reviewer have say about this hotel 's appearance be accurate .the grounds be immaculate , the decor be beautiful , the restaurant be decorate well , the pool be amazing , the beach be great ... clearly they have put a lot of money and effort into get this part of the property right .however there be some major , major issue with this place that i think other have touch but i feel really need to be elaborate on .particularly at this price level , these thing be just unacceptable i think .# 1 : the system they have in place for dinner reservation be absolutely absurd .there be 4 beautiful restaurant at the resort , all of which require reservation to eat at .that would not be so bad except you can only make reservation for that day from 9 be - 2 pm and for the next day from 6 pm - 9 pm .if you be arrive at the resort after 2 pm on the day you check-in -lrb- as we and many other be -rrb- you be out of luck for a dinner reservation on you first night .they will direct you to they dinner buffet which be little more then a taco bar but you can not eat the restaurant , end of story .we walk to the buffet take we by all the restaurant where we see at least 4 table open at each but they will not make any exception , even when we explain we do not have the opportunity to make the reservation for that night because we would only arrive at 5 pm and that they clearly have room for a party of 4 at one of they open table .this would be annoying anywhere but it be particularly infuriating when you be at a all inclusive resort and have already pay for dinner but they silly system will not allow you to eat where you want !at 6 pm -lrb- the first available time to make reservation for the next night -rrb- , we think we would figure out the system and get on the phone to make we reservation for we second night .somehow , even at 6 pm , the only time they have available for we be 9:45 !!!!when we challenge they on how and why this be possible , they just say that be all that be available ... no effort to help at all .you be explicity tell in you check-in material that you can only make reservation 1 day in advance but even then we could not eat until almost 10 pm ?!?!we eventually figure out that they be allow people to make reservation 2 and 3 day in advance -lrb- not what the information they provide when you check in say -rrb- so the first night we could get a reservation that be not 9:45 be we 3rd night at the resort .who want to deal with such hassle when they be suppose to be relax on vacation ?# 2 : as you can see , they staff be not very helpful .they seem more hasseled then anything when you address they with a question .we even have a spanish speaker in we group and that do not help .with a few exception most really could not be bother with explain why or what something be or even just smile and say hello when you pass they in the hall .again , totally not on par with what i would expect for a hotel billing themselves as a lead hotel of the world .# 3 : the food !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i simply do not understand how anyone can say this food be good , let alone great .we be absolutely perplexed by how horrendous the food be day after day at this resort , regardless of which restaurant or buffet we be eat at .what we originally write off as a fluke turn out to absolutelybe the norm there .food you would expect to be serve hot be warm at best , usually just plain cold .while there would be grill hot and ready to go , you could not get a burger cook to order .instead you have to take a pre-cooked burger , hot dog , etc from they chaeffer and use one of they stale bun .he cheese display sit in a refridgerate container with only 1 door -lrb- the other slide side be no where to be find -rrb- so it be warm and swarm with fly .chip on the nacho bar be stale , fries be cold and soggy , pizza be some disgusting frozen pizza ... i could literally go on and on and on .the food at they restaurant be not any better .we all comment that they appear to just take the gross food from they buffet and present it nicely on a plate .the french onion soup come out with a 2 square of yellow american cheese on top that be hard as a rock ... look like it have be microwave or something .in addition to just poor food quality , many of the dish be just tasteless and bland .we be all so disappointed in the food .none of we be picky eater and do not even have high expectation for the food ... this be not even school cafeteria quality .we all comment that a chili 's or tgi friday 's be 5 star compare to what they be serve .so in addition to make you wait until 10 pm , the food they give you be absolutely disgusting !you can understand why we be all look forward to go home and eat something decent -lrb- and by decent i mean chef boyardee would have be better then the pasta they be serve at this place -rrb- food .after pay this much for a place i would not expect any of these thing and would never recommend this resort to anyone .while it be beatiful and the drink be great , the overall experience be completely shatter by how hard it be to do something basic like eat dinner and then how disgust the food be .we be look forward to a relaxing vacation with friend , enjoy some great meal together .instead we spend much of we time discuss how gross everything be and how a place that be this beautiful could be overlook such a crictical piece of they guest ' experience .in short , if you be think about book at this place , do not .and if you already have , i suggest you pack lot of power bar or you will be subsist on box cereal from the breakfast buffet for you stay ."

american if they offer to speak we language .we arrive at we resort in 20 minute .we know well ahead of time that check in wasnt until 3:00 so we be prepare to be wait for a while .when we arrive at reception we be immediately give we wrist band so that we could get to the buffet area and get something to eat .-lrb- after a long trip wouldnt you rather have a seat , relax and have food ? -rrb-i dont think people realize that when they give you you wrist band this give you the opportunity to go anywhere in the resort , no question ask !if you think you might want to go to the beach wear you bathing suit under you clothes .after eat and relax for a while ... .it be we choice to stay at the buffet until the line clear ... i mean why rush we be go to be there for 10 day and we didnt want to start off we vacation with a bad attitude .we be immediately upgrade to a carribean spa sweet .we be on the ground floor .although out room have a leak we didnt really mind because we be warn ahead of time , and we be upgrade for free !!within 2 hour there be a repair man in the room fix the leak and we didnt have a problem for the rest of we vacation.there be so many activity to do both in and outside the resort we be glad we have 10 day so that we could do something different everyday and still have time to go to the beach.everynight have a different theme both at the buffet and at the show at 10:00 .every friday vendor come in so that you can shop in the resort if you sone feel comfortable leave .very accomodate if you ask I .if you want to shop you have to bargain , and these vendor look forward to it !if you be a cheap and spoil american like so many of we be ... .prove to they that just because we be american doesnt mean we be stupid and rich !!if you see something you like think about how much it would probably cost here .then ask how much it be .if you dont like the price then think about how much you would like to pay for it without be completely selfish because this be how they make a living .they will eventually give in .they also have a beach party with a huge bonfire and drink on friday .also on wednesday they have a disco tour .provide that you be at least 18 year of age you can pay 10 dollar to go on a bus to a local club for about 4 hour my friend and i enjoy it very much .also , the 10 dollar cover for one drink at the bar in the club .call card be expensive !!they be 10 dollar for about 25 minute .if you really have to make a phone call ... i dont know why you would have to because you be on vacation ... but you should probably stack up here before you go over there .if you choose not to use a call card its 2 dollar a minute.if you be adventurous and you dont mind hang out with local like I and my friend you can take the public bus and a taxi .all you have to do be ask and you will get the answer .the bus be 2 dollar if you go to the next city over call higuey and about a dollar if you go to plaza bavaro which be like a huge mall with alot if the same store and a few place to eat there be also a bank and a waetern union .if you need money out of you atm just make you you conver it over to peso ahead of time because the atm will only give you peso ... if you need american money you can walk over to the bank and they will give it to you free of charge .there be another place to shop its call el cortecito its a mini villlage with restaurant , shop , and supermarket .the supermarket have set price .i buy dive shampoo for 3.00 , pretty much the same that you would pay here .if you want to take a taxi to the plaza or el cortecito its about 6.00 .not bad consider you could stay for as long as you want .now , we also ask how much it would be to take a taxi to higuey its 50 dollar round trip and they wait 2 hour for you .so if theres two of you , you could pay 25 each and think of it as a mini excursion , or like i say you could pay 4.00 round trip and stay for as long as you want .my friend and i do this .we stop at la basilica which be a cathedral in the beginning of town ... of course we be immediately spotted and have people comee up to we ask we for money ... in the local town dont be afraid to have

bit of money .he say i wont give you a price ... you give I whatever you want .he give my friend and i a chance to discuss this and we agree .i tell he that if he be go to be with we that he have to try and keep other way that would try to hassle and persue we .he agree when he take we to la basilica he wander to the side give we a chance to take picture a be tourist in peace .he take we to

banana boat its 6.00 for 15 min but we bargain for a half hour.i have be to a much more luxurious resort in punta cana and there no way i enjoy myself nearly as much as i do at ocean bavaro .vacation be what you make of it .if you be the type of american that be not open to the spanish culture then go to cancun mexico where all the american go .or stay home and go to florida .vacation be about not haveng to do or worry about anything stressful the way we would normally do here .we get up late everyday have breakfast at 10 , lunch at 3 , and dinner at 9 sometimes we go to bed at 10 sometimes at 3 and if you be hungry at 2 theres a 24 hr pizza bar ... .the burger be the highlight.im hope to go back next year for 2 full week instead of 10 day ."

absolutely gorgeous , wide beach with soft , powdery white sand .the water be clear blue , and you can walk along the beach for mile and mile if you choose to .very pretty .the sound of the wave be about all you can hear on the beach , and it be very relaxing .the room be definitely acceptable .we stay in unit 292 , in the second row of bungalow on the first level .we could see and hear the ocean from we room and it be wonderful !!!!we love the privacy of the bungalow and be glad to have get a room so close to the beach .the room be always keep very clean by the maid .if you leave a few dollar , she will leave you one of the pretty towel/flower decoration .if no tip leave , no towel/flower arrangement .they will stock you refrigerator with 3 beer , never any more unless you leave a special request -lrb- and probably a few buck . -rrb-we be not in we room much beyond sleep and shower again in the evening before supper , so between the pop in the refrigerator , the liquor dispenser , and the 3 beer , we always have a evening drink to tide we over until we head out again .other thought : the food be not great , in we opinion .neither my husband or i be picky eater by any means , but we be both disappoint by the food .we never go hungry , but the flavor of the food be just not in agreement with we tastebud , even be open-minded .i would recommend ask for a table outside .we waiter be nice , but he be get drunk while serve we during friday night 's supper and forget to get we water and drink for half a hour !we be hope to have more opportunity to eat seafood , and after a week of hit-or-miss seafood option , we splurge on we last night and go to captain cook .$ 55 per person , but they pick you up on a bus , take you to the oceanside restaurant - very romantic !and you be give all the alcohol you would like -lrb- we have white wine and presidente beer -rrb- and a amazing , delicious meal with salad , appetizer , and a huge platter of seafood - it be incredible !!!finally satisfied we seafood craving and would make this trip to captain cook 's again in a heartbeat .they do not take credit card , however , so pack a extra $ 110 in cash if you want to check it out .some suggestion : 1 .take a few washcloth or a bath loofah as there will not be any washcloth supply in you room .2 .find a few wrist key-chain at the dollar store -lrb- as other review mention -rrb- .it be a easy way to keep track of you room and safe key .you can get a second room key for a ten dollar deposit , save you receipt , though , or you will have trouble get the ten buck back when you check out .3 .take a few insulate mug to save on trip back up to the bar .we also fill ours up before take off on a few stroll down the beach , and we 32 ounce mug get we there and back with outh get thirsty .4 .if you like seafood , there will be a poolside gumbo grill-out one day during the week - delicious !but they do not have much out there for food , so make sure you get there early !5 .one thing we be disappoint about be how several of the bartender seem to expect tip .we luckily have pack some extra cash after read other review on tripadvisor , but it get to be really annoying to tip so often when you have already pay for all-inclusive .6 .check out the outdoor hot tub at the riu palace macao after the sun have go down over the palm tree , but you be not quite ready to go back to you room .it be suppose to be just for palace people , but it be not guard and be completely desert when we go there .it be hide back in the foliage , and so relaxing , we feel like we disappear for a hour !!7 .check out the riu bambu - neat bar and a nice lunch area , too .great pool.all in all , a nice vacation .we would return to punta cana again someday , but not to the riu because of the food and because we want to check out some other resort .we friend have be at the iberostar and say it be excellent .avoid lti -

0,0,0,2,2,2,2,-1,"great time , but problem with the room .i read a lot of review about the occidental grand flamenco prior to travel there from april 18-25 .when we read about the problem people have with the occidental punta cana , we be optimistic that those people be just finicky traveler who insist on be treat like royalty .unfortunately , we run into a lot of the same issue that i have read about here .check in鈥擶e didn鈥檛 have any problem at check in .transfer to the hotel from the airport be a breeze , and a short one at that .when we arrive at the hotel , someone meet we in the lobby with a welcome and a glass of juice .we arrive at the hotel around 11am , and check in be not until 3pm .from read all of the review on this website , i be aware that half of the room at the resort have be renovate .when we check in , i ask the gentleman at the front desk if we could be place in a renovate room , and give he a $ 20 tip .he say he would see what he could do .we have a few hour to kill , so we check out the grounds , have lunch , and hang out in the lobby .when 3pm roll around , there be a huge line at the front desk .the guy i have speak to earlier remember I and immediately waive I over to the side of the counter .he say he couldn鈥檛 get we in a renovate room , but put we close to the pool and the lobby -lrb- which be very convenient for we -rrb- .the $ 20 i tip he didn鈥檛 get we a update room , but i figure it be worth since we didn鈥檛 have to stand in the long check in line .rooms鈥擧onestly , the room be the biggest disappointment for we .i have read a lot of review on here from people i specifically email we travel agent before hand about this , and i be assure we鈥檇 get a king bed .lo and behold , we have two twin bed push together .i go back to the front desk and ask about move to a room with a king-sized bed , but the guy at the desk tell I they be full and i would have to come back to speak to a manager the next day .at the same time i be there , someone who be on we transfer from the airport be yell at the front desk that the ceiling in he room be bow down and look it be go to cave in .we鈥檙e pretty lay back people and didn鈥檛 want to act like spoil tourist , so we just deal with the bed .however , once we get settle in , we notice a lot of little thing wrong with the room .two of the light in the room didn鈥檛 work .i try swap out bulb from one of the work lamp , but they didn鈥檛 work either , so it be a electrical problem .the refrigerator in we room didn鈥檛 work .my wife check to see if it be plug in , and she get a electrical shock from the plug .when i pull the fridge away from the wall a bit , i see that the electrical cord have fray and have no insulation on it for a good three or four inch from the plug .the water situation be also problematic .water come out of the shower in a very slow and small stream -- hardly any water pressure .i wound up remove the showerhead and showering under the open water pipe instead .two of the night , we didn鈥檛 have any hot water .again , we just suck it up and do we best to deal with it .on the last night , we didn鈥檛 have any run water in the room at all .the only issue we complain about be the slide glass door to we porch .we be on the ground floor , and the glass door didn鈥檛 close all the way or lock .we purchase the safe key -lrb- be sure to do this , by the way -rrb- for we valuable , but i still feel uneasy have a open and unlock door all the time .i speak to the apple vacation rep who be onsite and it be fix the next day .for what it鈥檚 worth , the hotel leave a maintenance request form in every room .i don鈥檛 know if that鈥檚 necessarily a good thing .we run into quite a few people who have similar problem in they room .we meet two couple who be on they honeymoon .both of they have pay for the honeymoon upgrade package .sometime during they stay , someone in the hotel 鈥渓ost鈥?the paper say they be entitle to the honeymoon package .other also have problem with the water pressure .weather鈥擳he weather be great .it rain a couple of time , but for the most part there be shower that move through quickly .it do rain very hard for most of we last day there , and that create some problem .the area around we building smell like sewage after the rain -lrb- i suspect this have something to do with we not have any run water the last night -rrb- .also , the building have a open architecture .the room across the hall from we be at the bottom of the step lead to the second floor .all of the rain water have run down the step and be go under the door to that room -lrb- the people stay there have towel roll up in front of the door and at the bottom of the step -rrb- .service鈥擳he service be great .we leave the maid a couple of dollar every morning .she bring we new beach towel twice a day鈥攐nce in the morning and once in the afternoon .when i leave she a note -lrb- use my limited spanish -rrb- ask for diet coke for the fridge , she replace all of the regular coke that be in the fridge and leave we a couple of extra every day on top .i wear a beat-up t-shirt with the sleeve cut off to the pool every day .when i it on the bed , she fold it in a fan pattern .we also get massage in the spa one afternoon , and they be very good .food鈥擳he food be pretty good .the buffet have a lot of choice and we didn鈥檛 get bore .the burger at the home rum place by the pool be fantastic鈥攖he late night pizza place be absolutely outstanding , especially of a few hour of drinking .there be four a la carte restaurants鈥擨talian , oriental , mexican , and a brazilian steakhouse .the resort only let you make reservation for three , but on we last night , we go to the fourth one and ask the maitre鈥檇 politely if we could come in despite not have a reservation .he seat we without any problem -lrb- after dinner i give he $ 10 and tell he how much we appreciate it -rrb- .the oriental place be awesome , the brazilian place be very good , and the other two be ok but nothing special to we .oh , and the coffee be great -lrb- i鈥檓 a big coffee drinker -rrb- .entertainment鈥擳his be the best part of the trip for I .the bartender be all fantastic .we make sure to tip the bartender a couple of buck each night , and it really seem to help .at night , the hotel lobby be usually pack with people drink at the bar .there be several time where i didn鈥檛 even finish my beer before the bartender take it away and refill my cup .there be entertainment in the lobby almost every night , and there be usually a lot of people dance and party .if you鈥檙e drinking at the lobby bar , be sure to have a shot of mamma juanna or , if you鈥檙e really adventurous , order a 鈥淩eady to go鈥 ?we never make it over to mangu , the disco .the pool and the beach be also great .culture鈥擶e take two excursion off the resort .one be the outback safari , where you tour the island on the back of a open truck .we visit a cigar factory , a coffee plantation , a typical dominican house , and then go boogie board on a secluded beach .it be totally worth it .the guide be great and we learn a lot .the second trip be a all-day affair on a air condition tour bus .we go to a small cigar factory in la romana , a underground cave , altos de chavon , and a shopping plaza which be little more than a duty free shop .we think this tour be way too long -lrb- we be go from the resort for about 12 hour -rrb- , and didn鈥檛 learn nearly as much .the picture we take at altos de chavon be amazing though .lastly , i hate shopping to begin with , but the dominican style of bartering be even more irritating .there be a series of shop a couple hundred yard down the beach .the people who work there be very aggressive about try to get you into they store -lrb- they鈥檙e worse than the timeshare people on the resort -rrb- .if you come in , they give you something small like a keychain or a necklace for free , make you then feel obligate to buy something .there aren鈥檛 price on anything , so be prepare to barter .one of the guy want $ 100 for a painting we see in another store for $ 15 .also , be aware of fake cigar .all in all , we have a good time in punta cana .we stay at the occidental grand aruba last year for we honeymoon and have a outstanding time , so this one be a little bit of a let down to we , but like i say , we try to make the best of it .i have to say that this website be invaluable in provide we on info about what to expect on we vacation .i hope this review help you plan yours ."

1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,"not there yet .after stay and dine at all the 5 star hotel in hong kong over the year , i decide its time to check out the new four season hotel in hk .i have hear conflict comment from friend of mine who have stay at the property during the past year .the lobby area be kinda sparse , with not much of a focal point .the check in and concierge counter be off to the side and the low ceiling kinda make the area feel cramped -lrb- as the lobby have a 4 storey height to it -rrb- .service be quick , efficient but be cold and without much of a four season touch .its as if they be there to get you in and out asap ... maybe that how they want it to be see - a efficient biz type like hotel - again , this be not a four season trait .the other better four season that i have stay in , offer a gracious charm to it , efficient but fill with care and warmth .diligent attention and a open to get u what u want and beyond that , get u who u do not know u want .fs george v in paris do that so well .thats the benchmark of all four season should be compare to.room be alright , a bright blend of east and west , view be quite good , if its a clear day , otherwise , u will be look out to a grey harbor .the funny thing be that the apartment block next to the hotel , which i understand be also manage by the four season in hk , offer much better harbor view .room at the apartment block face more towards the central and causeway bay direction , while the hotel block face more towards tsim sha tsui west and the macau ferry terminal .if you be look for the room with the best harbor view from hong kong side , this be not it .the harbor view room at the grand hyatt , shangri-la , conrad offer better views.i check out the dining facility at the hotel during the stay and have dinner at both the french and chinese restaurant .since the executive chef at the caprice come from le cing of george v paris , i expect a great meal .alas , that be not the case .quite disappointed be my feeling .service be like the check in - fast and furious .its as if they be try to outdo each other in try to get the table turn .see a waiter break some glass that be place in the long glass cabinet place in the middle of the restaurant .the rush rush rush feel do not do it for I in a french restaurant , especially with staff from george v paris run the place .i speak to the manager of the restaurant and make he aware of my observation and he concur .he be definitely not happy with the level of service be offer .as for the food , i be a frequent guest at le cinq , and the food at caprice be not a true reflection of what it be in paris .guess something have lose itself in the translation of the cooking .i understand that the executive chef from le cinq visit the restarurant a while back and be quite disappointed with the level of food .effort have be make to rectify that problem but i still do not see it as even offer the best french fine dining in hong kong .gaddi 's at the pen be still the best in this aspect .so much for my french fine dining.the chinese restaurant be modern , silverish grey in color and a bit cold .just like most of the staff at the hotel , the four season touch just do not show itself .one thing i have notice be that many of the staff seem to be a bit distance and act cool .thats again , not a four season trait - cool be just not four season .four season be all about warmth , openess , and willingness to aid and get the guest feeling top of the world.food at the chinese restaurant come in pretty dainty size offering , do not make the dining experience that great , as i be with a group of friend that all make comment that we need to double what we order .guess that what management decide to go with .again , i be disappoint with the chinese food , as i can get much better fare at many great chinese restauratn in hong kong .if one need just to entertain in central , i guess fs hk be a alright choice .if u need to entertain with great food , this be not the place to go.the swim pool area be pretty nice -lrb- located at and angle face tsim sha tsui and wanchai -rrb- , especially at nite and desert .the shimmering light of hong kong harbor and kowloon be always great to check out .for any traveller with friend with american club membership , u should check out the nite scene of hk from the club 's city location - located in side 2 exchange square , 49th floor -rrb- .all in all , f hk be a middle of the road four season , with much lack befitting a city like hong kong .it do not come close to the other great four season around the world .i place it on the same level as the four season in singapore and sydney , albeit in a brand spanking new building .and way way behind the four season flagship , four season george v paris ."

0,0,1,0,2,0,1,2,"secret excellence be not excellent !i want to start off this review by state that although i do expect a certain level of quality and service when travel i be by no mean a vacation snob .i be picky but not a snob .this be my second time in the dr. the first time we -lrb- hubby and i -rrb- stay at iberostar bavaro in nov 2004 and you can read we review at -lsb- -- -rsb- we be the 14th review down so we have a basis of comparison and think we know what to expect .we stay for 4 nights/5 days.overall i鈥檓 go to state right up front we think this resort be no where near a 5 star/6 golden apple resort .after be to other 5 star resort -lrb- iberostar in the dr , atlantis in the bahama , aruba , etc -rrb- this be somewhere around a 3 .my suggestion for anyone book at this hotel now or look to book be to contact you travel agent or tour rep and if you buy insurance switch !it鈥檚 free to switch and the only cost be any cost difference from you package to the one you鈥檙e switching too鈥?since you鈥檝e pay for a 5 star resort in most case it will either cost the same or be just a few dollar to switch .no amount of adult only exclusiveness can cover the thing that just aren鈥檛 5 star quality and make this vacation less than enjoyable .trust I switch now!let I also state that i book my travel after read another review with judy and marie travel -lrb- just do a search and you will find they -rrb- .this be by far the best decision about this trip that we make .if you be think of travel to the dr and be plan to use a travel agent i would highly recommend them鈥?heck even if you weren鈥檛 plan on use a agent i would still recommend use they .you鈥檒l get the same price and probably much better service at you hotel.drive : we get a private transfer instead of ride the bus .we figure with it already be a hour away a private van would be faster than take the bus鈥?we be right .the drive there be awful as we driver feel compel to race any car/bus/truck in front of we regardless of how far away it be .also it be very bumpy and terribly scary as there be plenty of pot hole and hill .they be build a new highway which i hope will make the drive through to the resort more pleasant.check in/out : my bil book a swim-out excellence room however when we book we just pay for the regular garden view room .when we arrive i be pleasantly surprise that the manager have arrange for we to receive a free upgrade to the excellence club because of maria and judy .i have ask maria to request a 3rd floor room as i have read those be nice and again they deliver .the only issue be that because we didn鈥檛 arrive with the other bus we have to wait about 10 minute until a excellence rep come to get we to walk we to the club to check in.excellence club : although a very nice touch and a great perk i would never ever pay the $ 70ish a day it cost to actually participate in this unless you really need internet access while on vacation .room : these be fairly nice .we be on the third floor , as request , and i be please to find out that they have elevator as i sprained my ankle just before come .each room have a sink/dressing area , a separate water closet/shower room , and a jacuzzi tub .the bed be definitely hard as rock .the room be always clean , no bug , and the maid service be very nice .we have turn down service which be a nice little extra .the only complaint here be that the minibar isn鈥檛 a actual refrigerator but more like a high end cooler .so if you open it often by the end of the day everything would be warm .for a five star resort you would think they could get actual minus fridge .also because we be on the third floor we room never cool down to where we like it but it be pleasant and workable .oh and make sure you keep the little do not disturb card in you outlet thingy at all times.resort : beautiful grounds .they have a nice little wildlife area and amazingly enough most of the animal stay within that area .we see a stray chicken by the pool area where we stay but that鈥檚 about it .we do see plenty of lizard which be cute .the best part of this resort be that there be covered walkway throughout the whole resort and you can walk around from the main lobby to you room and other important part of the resort without get wet on the few day it rain .this resort be much smaller than iberostar but just as lovely .the bug here however be another story and if you do come to secret bring bug spray .i spray daily and be fine until the last night when i run out and the next day be scratch like crazy.pool : secret have two pool .although we see the cascade pool since it be on the other side of the hotel we didn鈥檛 swim there .we mostly stay in the big pool -lrb- actually two pool since it鈥檚 cut in the middle but a little rock wall -rrb- which run most of the way horizontally along the beach and resort .the pool be lovely and we be very pleased to see king size bed with mild cover along pool as well as chaise lounge .the pool be about 4.33 ft deep everywhere which be great for everyone except I as i鈥檓 5 foot even and have to stay on my toe the whole time in the water .the blue floaty be hard to find mid day as people state but we get there early and stay late so we didn鈥檛 have a problem .i must say i don鈥檛 understand why they don鈥檛 have more of they .obviously they be at a premium and honestly for a 5 star resort they should have at least one per room available .the swim up bar be nice but we mostly stay on the other end and just have the lovely lady who circle the area bring we drink .my biggest complaint about the pool be that if you be short like i be get in and out of the pool be difficult .stair be located throughout the pool area but be space so far apart that i have to walk , on tippy toe , probably over 25 foot from where we be to the closest staircase .the only walk in access be on the far left side of the pool .not a big deal unless you really need to use the lady room .this basically cause to I to stay out of the pool most of the day.beach : very pretty but very rough .if you be use to the east coast water , like ocean city , md , then this be pretty similar to high tide .the only difference be that because the water be knee deep so far out the wave be break several time and cause a huge rip current .we be beach people and love to play in the wave but even we find it a tad rough.nightlife : the casino , where we spend most of we time , be probably twice the size of the iberostar .although it have a crap table it be never open which disappoint my husband .we mostly play blackjack and roulette and have a very nice time .this casino get pretty busy at night and honestly be lot of fun .however as the brochure from the hotel state beware of the keno game .they suck you in by give you a free turn to start but it鈥檚 a loosing game and we never see anyone leave win at this game all 4 night we play there but see several people loose hundred if not thousand of dollar .we try to catch two show but honestly unless you show up 30-40 minute before the show start you鈥檒l never find a seat where you have a good view and can hear well .what we see be okay and probably good give where you be .this isn鈥檛 vega and we never expect a vegas show but the sound quality could be improve .also show start at 10pm be a little late鈥 ust my opinion .we never go to the disco as it didn鈥檛 open till 11pm and honestly be quite a walk.food : the food here be just plain terrible !!!i don鈥檛 know a single person at the resort that i speak with that think the food be any where near a 5 star resort .my friend just get back from the secret in mexico where they can鈥檛 stop rave about the restaurant and such and all i can say be that i wish there be even a mcdonald around because that would have at least be better .i鈥檝e be to dr before and other caribbean island so i certain understand that we aren鈥檛 in the we but the food here be just plain bad .forget lack of flavor it be just poor quality .breakfast be by far the best meal -lrb- carlo the omelet guy be great -rrb- but in general even breakfast wasn鈥檛 that great .we try the italian and steak restaurant .we want to try to french restaurant but there be a two hour wait the first night we try and it be close the second night we want to go and since they don鈥檛 let you know ahead of time which day it close it鈥檚 hard to plan you time wisely .the best meal be the beach party because you could actually see they cook the meat and try to pick out the best cut that weren鈥檛 cook to a crisp .the fact that you can eat at any restaurant when ever you want be a nice touch if you don鈥檛 mind wait over a hour to eat at some of these place since they won鈥檛 take reservation .i understand the benefit of not have you have to make reservation but you should be allow to make they if you choose too鈥?it would make dinner time more enjoyable for most people .every day they have a special on the beach but it be locate so far away from the pool that you have to get dress to go and who want to be bothered鈥?another point that bug me鈥?you need to get dress to eat lunch because all the restaurant be away from the pool and the snack shack by the pool be nasty !i honestly could go on and on about the food but i will just say that the reason we choose to stay at secret this time be because when we be here two year ago people say how great the food and resort be in comparison to iberostar -lrb- and food be we only issue with iberostar -rrb- .maybe two year ago it be but now it鈥檚 at best mediocre food .absolutely not like a 5 star resort should be and unlike the iberostar where there be plenty of decent food around just everything be bland here the food wasn鈥檛 always fresh , be not of good quality , and honestly there wasn鈥檛 a great selection .yes we never leave hungry , per se , but we never feel like we eat well.dress code : this truly tick I off about the resort .they claim resort casual in most restaurant and i specifically packed nice clothing for this very reason .i hate dress up and would have love to wear shorts and comfy shirt the whole time but i understand that this wasn鈥檛 go to work here .my husband be a polo and jeans guy and be tell no jeans .we be both very upset to not only see people wear flip flop in the restaurant but some man be even wear shorts .all this would have be fine if there wasn鈥檛 such a big deal in all the brochure about the dress code.bar : i鈥檓 russian and shoot vodka frequently at family gathering .if that be real stoly鈥檚 they be serve out of they stoly鈥檚 bottle i鈥檝e get some ocean front property in arizona to sell you .the drink be either too light on the alcohol or too much alcohol and there be absolutely no way you will convince I that they have top shelf alcohol in the bottles.service : maid and room service be great !the lady walk around the pool to get we drink be great !the wait staff in the restaurant be terrible !ask for a diet coke and it鈥檚 like ask for diamonds鈥?in fact we start ask for the bottle in addition to glass of ice because it take over 20 minute to get we first round of soda鈥檚 never mind a refill .when we would ask for the bottle we would get look of sheer panic from the staff like the management would fire they for even consider give we the bottle .it be easier to get wine but anything that have to be mix by a bar tender or bring from the bar take forever .i think the biggest problem here be that most people we see be tip the staff regardless of service and tip often .so the staff be use to the tip and honestly didn鈥檛 work to get they .we stop tip after the first day and the service didn鈥檛 get any worse .i know that these people be overwork .i know the long hour they put in .but i also know that i be at a different resort with the same condition two year ago and receive service that be 1000 time better than here鈥?enough said.overall as i say this resort be possibly a 3 star probably less .if you鈥檝e never be to another 5 star beach resort you might think that this be a great resort because it鈥檚 get the general feel but it鈥橲 not !yes it鈥檚 beautiful .yes it鈥檚 relaxing .yes it feel like paradise .but it鈥檚 not 5 star .if this be you first trip out of the we and to the dr do not judge all beach vacation against this resort because you get so much more for the same money at other resort .for the money dr be one of the nicer island in term of value i鈥檝e travel too .the value be amazing .however i will never stay at this resort again .next time i鈥檒l go with what i know鈥?i鈥檒l go back to iberostar!if you have any question feel free to contact I at rinibini@aol.com .make sure that you put 鈥淪ecrets vacation question鈥?in the subject line ."

'or ` do you know of / can find I a mechanic ? 'prove too difficult or too much of a effort to understand and answer .one member of staff think we question be beyond the service the hotel provide .we have only ask he about where we could find a mechanic and not ask he to fix the car .when ask if they have internet , she reply ` no ' .i ask ` do you have a business centre ' ?she reply ` no ' .i say well do you know any internet cafe 's near by she say ` no ' .i assume the reason for she unhelpful abrupt answer because i may have interupt she have a happy chat with the colleague even though i have wait for she to finish.we have 3 people stay in we room .2 people for 2 night and 3 people for 3 night .on the last night with the 3rd person we be give 2 towel and no extra bed linen for the sofa bed .fair enough but then when we call reception to ask they on late saturday night to bring extra bed linen and a towel up - they do not !i order a taxi - the concierge tell I to come down as it be there .it be not there .i ask and be tell 5 min .i wait for 20 min , ask again but then no one know , until think it would be quicker to walk or take the tram rather than wait for the hotel to do anything for me.on check out i ask the receptionist to put a certain amount on my credit card and the difference on my friend 's card .i explain this to she three time .she then charge my card for the full amount .when i mention she mistake , she say , rather annoyed , that ' i have tell she to do that ' .i look at my friend rather puzzle as we have explain three time .she correct it.i think it would be a better hotel once fully do and certain staff member get lesson in communication and interpersonal skill .i would not stay here again .i prefer a hotel that more centrally located so i can walk to most place in 5 - 10 min as oppose to 20 - 35 min but on that note it be we fault for choose this hotel and interpret ` walk distance ' as mean 5 - 10 min ."

0,0,0,2,2,1,0,1,"my wedding my family i visit this resort in august 2004 .this resort be beautiful , clean , and the beach be everything you could imagen .front lobby have two grand stair case .exotic flower and furniture .after travel and the bus ride , we arrive at the resort and we wedding guest and i be in awe .staff be very polite , although it take roughly a hour to get to we room .when we book 6 month earlier we request the honeymoon suite as the wedding couple .but be give a ocean view room with two double bed .the view be breath taking .but we room be nothing special for a bride and groom .we speak with front desk and they say they could not help we with a room change .i find this to be of poor service to the bride and groom who undoubt should have a honeymoon suite.we have a wonderful time with family and friend through the first two day .then on the 3rd day we be inform we wedding which we have book for 5pm sunset on the beach for august 25th .be move ahead to august 24th .we have plan to have we wedding date on my father birthday since he have pass away and could not attend .this be disappointing , and again the hotel would not assist we in keep the same date as plan .also my father鈥檚 identical twin brother who walk I down the aisle be very upset in the change of date .the day of the wedding i go to the salon spa to have a gel nail repair and paint before the wedding while i be get my hair do .the girl in the spa have not see a gel nail product before , but insist they could fix it .the one girl tear the gel nail off but do so also remove most of my actual nail .this be my ring finger .i feel a panic start to set in , and they continue to tell I it be ok ... and they could still fix it .i be in pain , but also worry that as my ring finger be bare of a nail .i ask they to do something .so i place a small band aid over my open nail bed .and they glue a spare nail find in a vase to the band aid with hot glue .then paint this to match my other nail .i be horrify .i really do not know how to react .i leave the spa before have my hair finish .this be truely the worst service at a spa anyone could ever recive.also the morning of the wedding we be inform that the resort staff could not set up the beach for we wedding , as they say weather could turn at any moment .they then decorate the lobby balcony for we wedding .my uncle speak with the hotel manager and tell he we do not fly 20 guest at $ 1100.00 each to hold we wedding inside a building .so we be able to continue the wedding on the beach without flower or chairs.we pay $ 1200 we upon arrival at the resort for we wedding package , which we be tell include a wedding coordinator .but of course we be tell the wedding coordinator be away on business that week .everything i pick out from the book be not do for we .include type of flower .i pick a local exotic flower in a small bouquet .i get large peach rose that be weave into a flower display that go to the floor .the hire judge do not correctly say we name .but we proceed anyways .we do hire a band for a extra $ 375 we .which be worth every penny .they play music on the beach for the wedding , and then follow we to the beach bar where we socialize with family as the play beautifully .during dinner they play the entire time .and also play 5 song for we to dance too .although the dinner it be self be great from what i hear .i myself the bride do not get a meal ... and family i all inform waiter staff three time , then be tell the kitchen be close .this be all in a hour and half from the start of dinner the day after the wedding , i go to the safe to get some of my thing , and my austrian crystal martini necklace and match earring , with emerald and ruby olive on they be go .this be my wedding gift from my husband .i run to the front desk to report this , but be tell nobody could speak english and i would have to come back later .i keep go back every 10 min and ask to speak to the manager rueben .nobody could speak english when i need to report the theft .but on a different occasion i go to the front desk and ask for a room key to my mother鈥檚 room .they hand I one key with no question ask .this make I very uncomfortable as i only request a room number and not even by name .this resort be very beautiful and the beach be even more amazing .but hotel staff be impossible and i feel very disappointed even with all the excitement of we wedding .the more time that have pass i feel more rob of what should have be a amazing trip and celebration .i will not recommend this place to anyone planning to get marry .or look for a place with great staff .if you be look for a beautiful hotel and beach this be the place to go .do not bring anything you value , because they safe be not a safe place to store thing either.other wedding guest stay at the hotel also report theft of item , high heel , clothing , and money leave in shirt pocket from visit the beach market .my family be very easy go , and despite all this ... we still look back and say what a great time .and laugh about all the mis-hap ... but in all honesty no vacation or wedding should have this many problem ."

system just to tell we we room which have be assign to we originally , be sell to other guest just last week and there be no more room available at the resort for the first 4 night of we one week stay

room at we resort -lrb- bavaro -rrb- for we .but the room type be not what we have pay for .these be cheaper , smaller room with no view !we have no other option but to accept it and move on.as of today , they have not yet reimburse we the difference!they do smile and apologize in the end and promise they would make it up to we during we stay .they also say they would send 3 fruit basket to we room as apology gift .you can probably guess that we never receive anything !the problem be not the miss record , but that no one care enough to take charge to try to resolve the problem .they keep we stand for 3 hour at front desk , thirsty , hot and exhaust and nervous .we ask for at least water to drink and they keep say sure , we have phone the bar and they will bring you some water in a minute

all the troublemaker be among hotel guest / tourist .also , the local police/judge be extremely professional and helpful .there be fist fight over chair next to the pool and towel almost regularly .the security staff do too little to supervise or break the fight .as if they only job be to just hang out , dance and joke with guest and nothing more !the incident be too frequent and too violent to ignore .my husband and i personally witness two incident of violence attack -lrb- one against a young lady -rrb- and one theft which end in violence , all in front of security staff right at the pool side in the middle of the day .my husband , i and my brother in law bring they up to the manager 's attention at different point of time .we decide to report it to local police , since management refuse to take any report on anything regard security .the general manager try to stop we from report to the police .he try to stop we from call the police by refuse to give we the local law enforcement contact number .the general manager simply put it this way : if the police get involve , it will hurt my hotel reputation !we take it in we own hand with some other guest -lrb- two nice couple from latin america and one from europe -rrb- and rent a car to the closest police station to report the situation at the resort .we be receive by the local judge after a hour wait .she hear we case and order the police to check on the situation in the hotel and investigate/question the hotel security staff about the management cover up .she mention the tourist ' security be a priority in punta cana due to the scale of tourism industry in that region .police force show up at the hotel quickly to talk to the hotel staff and guest regard the cover up of violence and theft case .the manager have to listen and take the guest complaint seriously this time!after arrest a few guest and interview witness who come forward , the judge order one group of guest immediate deportation from the resort which be enforce by police the next morning!we could not wait to get out of there , thank god we be home safe and sound .let I repeat 2 important note in the end : first , all of the criminal be among tourist , not locals.secondly , the action of punta cana law enforcement and judge be very quick , professional and efficient.they really take tourism security very seriously .we will definitely go back to beautiful and peaceful punta cana , dominican republic .though we would not go back to bavaro iberostar.i would not recommend this particular resort to woman , family , or

i tip the maid a buck a day and take little thing from the dollar store as little gift , such as crayola pencil crayon for she child , little flash light , nail polishes/lip gloss , etc. and at the end of the trip , i give she alot of the girl summer clothes 'cause they will not be fittin ' they next year , therefore she could use they and she really appreciate it , clean towel and all every day.now , while at the bahia , the first impression be wow , until you get to you room , which happen to be in the back of the property , near the dumpster , and the sewage collection , the room suck , no door sweep on the bottom , therefore , bug , and i do not mean one or two , i mean literally , a infestation of hundred of creepy crawl millipede , on the wall , the drape , the floor , and brace yourself , the bed !of course we immediately request a room change , and be tell that oh most certainly we could move , but for 30 $ we per night !well , i do not think so !i be totally serious about the wormy creeper in the bed too -- i complain big time , show the maid , and the manager and they laugh at I because they think i be afraid of these little bug , they solution , i get a can of insecticide that i be to spray , really good for grow girl to inhale.food at the barcelo bavaro -lrb- bb -rrb- be good , every nite be a theme evening , one night mexican , the next perhaps , chinese , and so on , it be truly edible and always fresh and hot , with ton of variety.at the bahia principe -lrb- bp -rrb- , the food buffet be the same each and every night with the exception of a few different dish throw in .the food be tasteless , cold and just plain blah -- and if you be a bacon lover , there be no bacon at the bp in the morning , we be there for a week and not one slice of bacon be seen.the beach at the bb be beautiful , absolutely pristine white sand with the aquamarine colour ocean -- breathtaking -lrb- do get a few little bite from teh sand flea -rrb- but be prepare for that from read the reviews.ok , the bp -- the beach consist of hotel employee fill up huge cloth bag with the gritty thick brown sand and lie they side by side , as the tide wash the beach away , one day we walk the entire beach and it be flat , the next morning we walk it again and half the beach be go , it have be wash away , so these guy literally build the beach back up daily , the water be horrid while we be there , it be quite wavy and therefore the water itself have be churn up and be brown and filthy with sand bit .in neither place do we spend alot of time on the beach , for the simple reason of the flea , you do get alot of bite and they itch like mad.drinks bb beer be okay , a little watery but so be every thing else .you can flash a buck at the bartender and he will whip you up whatever you want fresh and forego the slushie machine drinks.over at the bp , the drink be much the same , they be slushie machine drink , spin with ice all day , so they too be quite watery , same rule apply tip a buck and you will not be sorry.staff at the bb , be friendly and accomodate , to we they provide every thing we request and be quick to do so .as be the maid , bartender everyone.now the bp , like i say , they laugh at we for be afraid of the crawl worm in we room , they would not move we only for a charge .no service at the pool .waiter make strange meow noise at we rather good look daughter -- do not go over well with dad !not accomodate what so ever , they do not speak english -lrb- or at least they do not to I -rrb- and make like they do not understand what you be say .there be ton of european at this resort , and some of they be very friendly while other be quite bold , but into line etc. i suppose that happen all over at this type of place , just sit back let they go first then get in line when the feeding frenzy be near be done.all in all , i would most certainly go back to the bb in a split second , the bp will never go back there as long as i live , and this place be recommend to I by the travel agent , she apparently have be there !i ask she if she be on glue when she be there or something , man it be a horrible spot , but of course -- ya get you kid there so you have to make the most of it for they and i suppose you be off work for the week and there be no dish or laundry to be do -- puerto plata be the grungiest place i have every see , punta cana be cleaner and less populated.hope this help , as for the -lrb- bp -rrb- just dont do it !you know how when the bus come to pick you up to take you to the airport , most of we sorta feel like oh this be it , and sort of loiter around the bus , well at the bp people be actually fight to get on the bus to get outta there asap -- honestly it be that bad !!!"
