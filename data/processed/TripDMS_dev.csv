2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,the best vacation ever - paradise the resort be gorgeous .the service be superb .the staff work so hard thorughout the day and night you feel bad for they .there be never a glass or plate or ashtray or anything that be leave behind uncleaned or sit .when you leave you room you could not help but smile - each staff member would greet you with a huge smile and say ola .the ocean be beautiful - bluest water and white sand .the food be great - except for the dominican restaurant .the japanese restaurant be the best ... .if you call the night before at 9:00 pm for the next day you be sure to get reservation for you favorite restaurant .the bartender be great - there be nothing they could not make for you .they have every type of liquor that you could want .the only slight issue be the walk - it be about 20 minute to walk to different place - but i enjoy it because you eat so much the walk feel good .we will definately go back .we think about the time we have there everyday .we make great memory .
0,2,0,-1,1,-1,0,-1,"horrible location we visit barcelona on holiday for 4 night .as soon as we arrive at the fira palace we begin to suspect that we have make a mistake in choose this hotel .it be a business hotel located next to the fira barcelona which be a huge facility that host trade fair .there be nothing appealing within walk distance , and navigate to the subway -lrb- a 10 minute walk at least -rrb- be difficult .cab fare to la rambla be 7 euro which mean you have 14 euro in transportation expense every time you venture out unless you like to walk in which case it take 30-40 minute each way.in addition to the unfortunate location , the bed be as hard as a slab of granite which make any activity other than actually sleep impossible and sleep itself be difficult .the hotel staff be indifferent and there be no doorman to help with luggage .after one night we move to hotel 1898 for a few euro more and be very pleased ."

0,0,2,-1,2,-1,0,-1,"buyer beware let I say that i normally wouldnt write a review since i believe most have it out for the hotel but when apple vacation offer this place up as a 6 golden apple hotel they couldnt be more wrong .it might be a four red apple hotel .i will start with the positive .nice big room , nice pool , clean resort , two good restaurant and good entertainment staff .now for the bad , hardly any of the restaurant worker speak english .every day seem like a hassle when ask the cook something .one day they have honey out instead of syrup for breakfast , it take 4 different worker to finally get someone to get syrup .by the time they get it out we food be cold .every day they run out of orange juice and when you ask someone they would say 5 min , 20 min later and still no orange juice .one day my wife and i witness a worker drinking we of the plastic bottle in which they serve the coke and put it back in with the soda they serve the guest , if that be not disgusting i dont know what be .we report it to the manager and he say thank you .now that be 5 star service .in the restaurant the service be as slow as can be .expect to spend about a hour at each place .for the most part once seat it take about 10 minute before they bring you a water and about 15 min for a soda and dont even think about get refill .my wife and i on average wait 10 min or longer for refill once we be finish and the staff didnt look extremely busy .now for the room service , i believe this be do twice a day and the only issue we have with that be that they leave flower on you towel which have ant in they .we didnt have a huge issue with this since they can clean up but it be still something you dont expect out of a 5 star hotel .also 4 out or the 8 day they do not bring wash cloth .they bring towel but not wash cloth so we have to call down to have they bring they to we room , which be 6210 .if you can try to get a 3rd floorl room since they have vault ceiling in they if you decide to still go.now if you be still decide on go to the dominican i hope you be the type that like to lay by the pool or stay on the ocean since there be really nothing else to do .they offer very few excursion and since i enjoy excursion on a daily basis i wouldnt recommend the domincan republic .we do two of they , the outback safari which be a big waste of money since they drive you around dirt road to see how people live and the maranarium .the maranarium be pretty neat since you get to swim with 10ft nurse shark and huge stingray .i would recommend this excursion .anyway like the title say buyer beware , maybe i just hit a bad week or maybe that how the staff really be .all the people on we plane have the same compaint as we do so that show something .compare to other all inclusive , sandal ocho rio , iberostar lindo riveria maya , riu puerto vallarta i would rank this as the worst and with no comparision to the other ."

1,0,1,2,1,2,1,0,"do not feel like a four star hotel ... to be honest , i expect more from a fairmont hotel .while the fairmont copley plaza be situate in a beautiful , historic building , you do not really get much in return for the price you pay to stay in this hotel .the mini-bar price be absolutely outrageous -lrb- $ 7 for a bottle of water ! -rrb-, and the internet fee be ridiculous -lrb- $ 14/day -rrb- .luckily , i be a member of they president 's club so i do not have to pay the daily internet fee .though the hotel be in a great location and right next a enormous indoor mall , we be give a room with no view , and the furniture be rather old and musty look .i expect a better room -lrb- perhaps with a actual view -rrb- for a president 's club member .i would not stay at this hotel again ... i would recommend the bulfinch hotel which be also in downtown boston , cheaper , and nicer room without the outrageous price !"
0,-1,0,0,1,1,1,-1,horrible room i find this hotel on travelzoo and for the price of $ 109 per room/night it seem great value consider the review on tripadvisor .unfortunately we be disappoint when we get there - the room be tiny - and one of they -lrb- 607 -rrb- must have be a convert cupboard as it have a tiny strip window 6 ft from the ground - the colour be a depressing brown .there be no air conditioning in either room.the location be in the financial district - good for if you be in town on business or shopping in union square - for we though fisherman 's wharf be a better and more happen place to stay with children.staff be very nice - they mention that i would have to pay a $ 100 early departure fee as i agree to it when i check in -lrb- i do not think so ! -rrb-and be quite happy to waive this when they hear what room we be in -lrb- 602 and 607 -rrb- .so no i would never stay here again - or a kimpton hotel for that matter - i find it incredible that there be so many positive reveiw for this hotel on this site.by the way this be my first ever negative review on tripadvisor !

customer at each resort lobby to explain the available tour and other activity in the country , the rep at the meetin cover most question plus tour to medical emergenccy , for those unaccustomed to foreign country he put you at ease that they be always avaiable even give he cellphone number say call 24/7 also tnt have a large booklet at the main desk with all the info they give you in case you miss something .would not hesitate to use they again , the bus be top quality .the resort , some people will find anything complain about .all in all we have a great time .that be say we go with the idea of want sun , beach and relaxation , no spring breaker , no child , and late nite life be not important .so we do not try the disco .we find the room clean and as advertise , the exception be the bathroom it be a little worn in place , example the couple of rust spot in and around the tub from be chip , -lrb- come on guy that a easy fix -rrb- , some grout around the tile work again a easy fix .the room be clean , we leave $ 4 for the maid every morning and always find it spotless with fridge refill , ask for extra towel once and get they every day of we stay , please bring a little something to leave for they we bring school supplies crayon , color book and leave they with she .room key we always have problem with one not work , we would take it to the main desk who quickly replace it then the other would not work , after three time we give up and just rely on the one key , probably should have make they give we two new key .electrical , be 110 volt just like in the u.s. other have say you need a adapter , you do not what you need be a extension cord with additional outlet as there be only two outlet in the room , plus they outlet be recess in the wall , anything that plug in with the cord come out the back be no problem , but hair dryer cellphone charger with large block that the prong come out of will not fit in the recess , they do sell extension for $ 1.00 each or you might finagle one out of maintennace like we do , but for the agrravation its easier to bring a extension cord with mutiple outlet and/or one of those gray color two prong to three prong adapter you can get in home depot for 75 cents.food the restaurant be excellent but a pain to wait in line to make you reservation for and then to find they be never more than 1/3 full .service be always exceptional , the dominican people be as everybody say unbelivable friendly , do be generous and tip they ... we talk to one and could not believe the work schedule they have .its almost from sun up to sun down with something like 12 day on and two day off unless they need then no day off .or no job ..many work mutiple job on the resort through out the day and yet ..still be as friendly

to see the tray of meat out on display without cover or protection from the patron -lrb- same for the coldcut , they look like they be always out to long -rrb- or for that fact watch the cook pick up the meat with he bare hand and toss they on the grille ... come one at least give the cook a set of tong or something .if you like salad you kinda of have to improvise between the mex table -lrb- onions/peppers -rrb- and the salad bar for everything ... the entire time i be there i do not see a tomatoe that look edible , but the rest be fine .we do not find the meat over cook as other have complain and it be easy enough to make request to the cook ... the pasta cook be a experience definetly try it .all in all with a few exception and common sense the food be excellent both at the buffet and restuarant .the beach although we do not get into any war over lounge and not be early riser -lrb- hey we be on vacation -rrb- it be a problem with people reserve lounge with they towel , what be worse we would sit on the beach from 10-11 be to 5 pm and never see anybody near most of these reserve lounge .it be a problem and they should figure out how to address it .they constatnly be clean the grounds plus rake and pick up the beach .they should be able to monitor this better .if you a prude or have child , the toplessness , thong , and speedo although not everywhere be out there ... the place be heavily favor by people from s. america and europeon ... to they its not a big deal ... so when in rome i guess ... we actually quietly joke about it , the one that do should not and the one that could do not .anyways if you not use to it you could be offend .the night life around the main lobby be subdue but good for a after dinner nightcap , the entertainer be excellent as other

of tequila sunrise with no kick .only one local beer be avaiable as well as the local coffee both be actually very good .the beer be meduim body kind of like miller or michelob , not watery or light like bud .you do need to deal with the language barrier , but the dominician be patient with you , reciprocate .all in all its a nice relaxing resort for the money its a deal the few minor thing i

american/texmex one restaurant with terrible food , hardly edible , poor service , staff not very friendly.seafood ; food be good , again service not great , staff seem very unhappy.italian ; the best they have to offer , we eat there twice and the staff be always friendly .don鈥檛 let the beef dish in the buffet turn you off in this restaurant as the beef be a real treat.japanese ; never eat there , as we feel that a all inclusive should not charge and we refuse to pay $ 15.00 per person for a meal.buffet ; the food be the same all week , breakfast be about the best , good omelet and bacon -lrb- when they have it -rrb- with a nice selection of bread .lunch and dinner be the same thing all week , not much taste , and many many fly all around the dining room .i have be to other resort where they have a open buffet , this one be close in and i think there be more insect there then anywhere else .dessert be very sad , nothing like other resort , again very little taste , and the same selection .on a good note the staff be the friendliest and always serve you with a smile .beach : the resort be situate next to natura park and be probably on the worst section of bavaro beach , a lot of seaweed , even though the staff be good at rake it up daily , the water wasn鈥檛 as clear or clean as i鈥檝e see at other resort and there be a lot of boat anchor all over the beach area .the beach need cleaning , as garbage and glass be lie around .the only person we see do anything be a boy pick up the cup and take they back to the bar .we walk up the beach -lrb- about a couple of mile -rrb- and the two resort next door weren鈥檛 any better .however , the water be lovely and warm so we certainly take advantage of the beach , but it could have be a lot cleaner .entertainment : where do i start鈥?we arrive on saturday so the first show be the highly anticipate 鈥淢ichael jackson鈥?show , music be good , as it be original and the dancing be great .they apparently contract with a group that travel from resort to resort with the same show , they be not on staff .we didn鈥檛 know this at the time and think great good entertainment , next night be the caribbean show , terrible dancing , all they do be scream through the show , not much entertainment and people be actually leave .this be the same night after night , people leave before the show end it be terrible .on a good note they have some nice music and dance for the child .grounds/pools : beautiful , mature tree , and flower , nice layout for a small resort .not very many maintenance man clean up the dead palm or plant , they need more staff , as the place could have be cleaner .pool be nice , large main pool with a swim-up bar along with various section in the pool for play volleyball , swimming , or just sit around enjoy the jet .there be two other pool , which be located between building make they rather lengthy but nice and quiet for swimming .there be also a adult pool which we see but never swim in .my only complaint about the pool be that i never see any maintenance or cleaning of the main pool the entire time i be there .remember my room be overlook the pool , so you鈥檇 think i would have see some chemical be add especially to a swim-up bar pool.unwelcomed visitor : this be certainly not my favorite subject , but one i feel be necessary .this resort have very large cockroach , crawl around .i didn鈥檛 see any in the room , 鈥渢hank god鈥?but they be by the bar and casino .they also have rat , not mouse , but big rat .now i don鈥檛 know about you , but i didn鈥檛 feel like i should pay a good sum to see rat .i be not foolish , i know rat be mainly around food area , but these one be see by the pool and by the building where we stay .i have never encounter rat before and pray i won鈥檛 again .i believe the trouble with this resort be due to the location .it be right off the main street , where the garbage be all over , housing for the local be located about 300 foot from the resort and there be a major sewage problem outside off the resort .nice welcome !!!conclusion : i feel we didn鈥檛 make a good choice this year but we certainly didn鈥檛 let the resort spoil we time .if you have already book you trip go with this knowledge but make the best of it , as you be the one who will lose out in the end .if you be shop around for a resort , be aware of what i say , it be the truth , i have nothing to gain by write this review .we all learn from we mistake and hopefully this won鈥檛 happen to we again .if you be in you thirty or younger you may not mind this resort , as there be lot of young people around have a great time .my husband and i , along with we friend be in we fifty and we like to have a resort that be cleaner , friendlier , with more feature .the grand oasis be a small resort , with a casino , three bar , one by the beach , one in the theater and one locate by the main pool , a theatre , spa , fitness centre , internet , and several small very expensive shop .if you have any question please email I and i will try to answer they ."

0,0,2,1,2,1,1,-1,"be sure to read this i just get back yesterday and couldnt wait to post my review of this place after read other for the past 3 month .i stay here sept 14 thru sept 21 .my room number be 2153 .this have be my 3rd all inclusive vacation .other be iberostar punta cana and barcelo riviera maya .i have vacation alot in the past but usually rent condo or house in florida .also i be single and travel alone.first i want to say , some post here suggest that european be rude .i be from the u.s. and i think rude people come from all country .i do not discriminate .i use gogo tour .all transfer be very smooth with no problem .they use mercedes van that be very nice .pull up to the resort , it be very impressive .at check in there be no line and immediate .i ask for a top floor room and get the 3rd floor .4 be the top .next i inquire about the phone card that you could buy in the lobby and use on the lobby phone .they say they dont do that anymore .they offer I to use a booth next to the front desk and charge 2.50 per minute .i make 2 short call back to the we cost 6.00 .i think that be fair .next they bring I to my room .it be extraordinary and very clean .nice furniture and marble .probably one of the nicest hotel room i have ever have .however , i be toward the front of the hotel , close to the lobby , and have to really look hard to the right to see the water .below be a access path that be make out of brick that constantly carry employee with cart to and from the resort make noise .tv work well with many channel in english .nice jet tub with shower and two sink .mini bar be stock but the fridge in the room do not get cold .i iced down one of the sink for cold beer .i do like the brahma beer they have .its a pilsner and be good when ice cold .also one of the chair on the balcony keep come apart .the arm keep come out of the socket .i use the other one .i do notice the hard bed .however the sheet pillow and blanket be wonderful!my biggest problem with this place be there be no way to lock the front door to keep out the maid or drink re-stocker .the 1st night i be there i use the do not disturb sign and keep it on the door thru the next morning .i have breakfast and then go to the orientation with the gogo tour guy .come back to the room and get ready for the beach .i guess the maid didnt like the fact that i have the sign on the door the whole morning .because , when they clean the room that morning she take the sign and leave another clean room as soon as possible sign .why would i need two of these ???the next morning i get up and to the beach early .i leave a note for the maid to replace the do not disturb sign .she do not .after the day be over i come back to my room and my note be go but there be still 2 clean room sign hang on the door .i didnt do anything more about it that evening .the next morning at about 9 am , i be asleep and the maid knock on the door .i say go away but she come right in and say hola , oh you sleeping .duh ... well after that i get up and take a shower .i be wear a towel get clothes to put on and then the drink re-stocker decide to come in ..i tell he to go away .he ask dont you want I to re-stock you fridge ?i say no and think , not while i be naked .after go to the beach and get back to the room , it have be clean but the fridge didnt get re-stocked .i go to the front desk that evening and request i get the propper sign to hang on the door !they have one there after i get back from dinner .also the next day , the re-stocker guy only leave I 2 beer .i guess he didnt like I tell he to go away .that be the only time they come in on I but i use my sign continuously .that doesnt keep they from yell at each other outside you door wake you up at early hour .they could be quieter and not yell and slam door at 9 am .after a late night , you want to sleep in , this be vacation right?ok , enough of that , let I go back to some of the positive .the beach be one of the best i have ever be to .i like the shipwreck off the coast in front of the resort .the sand be nice with plenty of shade or sun whatever you prefer at the moment .i have nice weather every day with a little rain a couple of night .the food for dinner at the buffet be pretty good .i do not like wear long pants for dinner .if you go out walk at night afterwards , you would get pretty sweaty wear they .i could not wait to put shorts back on after i eat .i try to eat healthy , fish , veggy , etc. breakfast be need a little help though .the dish of scramble egg be more like soup .sometimes the bacon look like it be still move .i like mine cook !i like hash brown for breakfast , not french fries .but i didnt really come here to gorge myself ... i really enjoy the sport bar .i do not pay the 3 dollar that it cost to play pool .i guess if it be free , nobody would get to play it would be too busy .also one night i get there and order a margarita .very yummy ... but when the bartender ask I if i want another , i sad no and switch to beer .i about fall off my stool when she take the lime from my used glass and put it back in the container where it come from !!!wow !i didnt lick it so i guess it be ok .lol !i do not try the 24 hour snack that be in the fridge .be too scared .i do try the slot in there for 20 buck .they dont seem to pay out much but i be not suprise .note , i be just in vegas 2 month ago.the first time i go to the pool , i burnt my foot walk to it .i figure out after that to wear flip-flop to the edge and then get in .it be too warm .i only use it only a little .i like the beach much better .which bring I to another problem .i use a cooler cup at the beach to keep my beverage cold and plentiful .that be nice and work well the first four day .the 5th day i go down and ask the pool bartender to fill it with diet pepsi , he look at I and say the problem with that be , we have people who deliver diet pepsi to you on the beach .i say it have not be a problem until now ??he proceed to go ahead and fill my cup .then say salute .i make it to my beach chair to find he fill it with orange drink .it be ok but he know what i want !i think this place be all inclusive ?can they not spare a cup of soda ?i guess not since they recycle the limes!let I add that most of the people work she be very nice .i even tip some of they .just a couple of they take I off guard ... i do not do any excursion off the resort .i figure i have pay enough to stay there .i do catch the michael jackson show at the macao next door .that be good .the other show i see be back at my resort .they be good with the guest be participent .that be funny and make I laugh .however , one of the show , they lip-sink the whole thing .i do not make it till the end ... pretty bad .something definatly worth see , be the view down the beach to the north .its a good walk but well worth it !take a leave out of the resort and go until the bend in the beach .i just want to see what be on the other side .i make the mistake of not bring a camera ... very breathtaking with the mountain in the background!i do buy a t-shirt in one of the shop for 10 dollar ... think that be a good deal .i do not try any of the ala cart restaurant .i wish i have but didnt want to deal with the wait that morning or have any schedule to meet .i be please with the dinner buffet anyway .ok , on to leave now .yesterday morning when pack my suitcase , i notice someone have break the strap on top that carry another attach bag ... this could have be american airline , but i do not notice it pick it up at the airport .the bus driver take it from I and give it to the bellman at the resort .the bellman bring it to my room and put it on the shelf and it stay there the whole time .oh-well .this be only the second time i have use this suitcase , it be new !they obviously pick it up with the strap instead of use the handle .the plastic buckle break and you know whoever do it know they do it !of course , they be not go to let you know .when leave i let the other bellman take my bag to store until my ride arrive .i only have a 30 minute wait .he may have roll it a total of 20 foot for I but look very dissatisfied when i didnt give he a tip !also when i turn in my key and pool card , the person at the desk just say its ok .they could have say thank you ???needless to say , i will probably go back to rent condo and house in florida ... .i hope this post help !p.s. the flight to and from miami offer some very good view of the bahama ..i take picture from the plane on the way back !"

2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,"nice but a bit sterile , with smaller room i stay in the tokyo park hotel at shiodome -lrb- not to be confuse with several other park hotel -rrb- for 6 night on business .as other review note , it can be difficult to find if arrive by cab -lrb- the road be very complex and under construction -rrb- or by train -lrb- the train station/office complex be huge -rrb- .best bet for arrival be by limousine bus from the airport.the entire hotel , from lobby to restaurant to guest room and bathroom be beautiful and immaculately clean .it no doubt help that the hotel be only 3 year old .the room be well design and quiet , and have especially nice attention to amenity in the bathroom .bed be very comfortable and there be excellent attention to lighting control in the rooms.the location in the shiodome area be very convenient for easy transportation to almost everything in tokyo -lrb- or outside tokyo , for that matter -rrb- .the hotel connect directly to the shiodome station for toeus -lrb- newer , private -rrb- subway line and the yurikomome elevated train to odaiba ; and it be a 10 minute enclose walk to the shimbashi station for tokyo metro subway and jr station -lrb- yamanote line as well as several other line , e.g. , to kamakura -rrb- .it be only a few minute by train to tokyo station for the bullet train .as other have mention , it be also about a 15 minute walk to ginza , tsukiji fish market , etc.the downside of the location be that take a cab to the hotel be quite difficult .it be essential to pick up one of they map card to show the driver .also , the shiodome complex be sterile -- full of office building and chain store .although the enclosed nature of it be convenient when hot or rainy , it can also be claustrophobic , like live in a shopping mall.you may be wonder : why be the hotel so much less expensive than other top hotel in tokyo , especially since it be new and beautiful ?i think there be two reason : the room be relatively small for a luxury hotel , and the hotel provide relatively few service , compare to 5-star hotel .the regular room with king bed allow very little room apart from the bed .i stay in a upgrade corner room which have a separate small sit area , but it be still fairly crowd , even for just one person .it would be fine for two people , but would probably feel quite small if a child be add -lrb- and would be impossible for more than 3 -rrb- .on the other hand , you be likely not to spend a lot of time in the room anyway .one thing to remember , though , be that extra room be very nice when one or more family member suffer jet lag and wake at 4:00 am.as for service , there be many thing the hotel do not have : a fitness center , a pool , business service -lrb- apart from a couple of computer -rrb- , a variety of restaurant -lrb- only two -rrb- , etc. those thing be probably of main concern to business traveler .for instance , i need to make more business card , which they could not do , unlike other hotel i have visit in tokyo.finally , the open atrium style architecture of the hotel -lrb- a 10-story high open central space -rrb- be dramatic and lovely , but it have a drawback -- one feel as if on display .eat at the main breakfast area in the lobby , one sit at the bottom of the open area .all sound be magnify by the echo chamber effect and the hard wooden floor .i feel like i should not talk -lrb- it echo all over -rrb- and must walk quietly .when i drop a umbrella , it resound loudly throughout the restaurant area .-lrb- fwiw , a better place to sit for breakfast be in one of the side room , which also have view -rrb- .so it definitely could feel awkward come or go through the lobby with boisterous children.in short , be it a good deal ?absolutely .be it a good location ?yes , very much , as long as you get out of the shiodome complex .if travel alone , i would be happy to stay there again .however , it be not really fair -lrb- or the intention of the hotel -rrb- to be compare against five star hotel with complete range of service and spacious room ."

from negotiate in espanol be a pain for I the whole calculator game .the vendor do not bug or harass you because the policia keep they all in line .you rarely see a local on beach selling anything but shell guy .they all must wear white shirt with artesan logo on to prove they pay they license fee to govt .no independent work the beach , all govt control .that be a negative to I , i prefer more choice place to beach shop .too many policia on my property all time of day night .i hear they be serious about make sure that dr do not become like ja .police be to make you feel safer , the opposite effect for I as i do not like to vacation in a place that require guard to protect you 24/7 with gun draw ready .iberostar -lrb- as all hotel do -rrb- have dance lesson daily around the pool .i be not into the salsa , merengue or bacchata dance that be so popular there but ra get up take lesson enjoy the music .i be hooked on reggae so it do not do anything for I .i be so sick of hear many foreign

.entertainment in general encouraged guest to join in game or contest see that everyone be talk to have a good time .i do not love the hotel food although i do not starve but eat hamburger , hot dog , chicken fries for lunch everyday that get old .the variance they have be all seafood base dish neither ra or myself eat fish .chicken be my dish i never tire of it discover iberostar have delicious rotissere chicken at lunch at beach restaurant .breakfast be usually good have fresh fruit , fruit smoothie , excellent pancake , french toast , bacon although not cook crisp usually , egg or omelet cook to order , roll bread to die for .coffee be abundant but we have a hard time get wait staff to bring we water with any meal .it be coffee with milk for breakfast soda or drink for lunch , dinner wine be serve but agua be impossible to get .the oriental specialty restaurant la pagoda have the best wine food of any of the specialty restaurant we try .the steakhouse on beach be disappointment , meat be flavorful but tough .i do not see any reason to get dress up when i be sit in sand for dinner either .la marimbe pork be gross tasting inedible so we leave there go over to buffet for dinner.no difference really between dominicana vs punta cana iberostar although the bavarro section be nicer .they have sign at dinner buttet for international buffet american style cuisine but the food at both restaurant be exactly the same everyday .really not 2 different restaurant but 2 separate by pond that flamingo hang out in .we learn why you should not feed the flamingo , we watch a little boy feed they cook clam they become aggressive bite at other guest as they walk by because they want more food .some guest do not read the sign or just ignore they .food be more european choice always with seafood so it be less than my favorite choices.i may sound pretty negative but i do enjoy myself but not big rush to return there .prefer a english speaking island , more beach vendor , less police , more american , reggae music , less surf , just a more relaxing island like jamaica .i would recommend iberostar for a hotel choice in d.r. as well as grand bahia principe but riu other property along the beach be visibly run down we hear many complaint on the return flight home .i think next trip to d.r. i will try another area , i miss my sunset 6am be too early to get up for

-rrb-and crystal clear .if we ever go back , that be where i will be take my snorkel gear.finally , the food .my husband i be very much into good food and , though we be not food snob , we tend to travel on we stomach .the food at the la cana be , in we opinion , really quite good for a buffet restaurant .both at breakfast and at supper , there be always a wide variety to choose from -lrb- include some local speciality , which we appreciate very much -rrb- and , as far as we could tell , the food be always freshly prepare .all in all , we be quite impressed with the buffet offering - which be a relief because you do not really want to take a 3-year-old to a 脿 la carte restaurant more often than you have to .that say , we really enjoy la choza restaurant for lunch : it be right on the beach -lrb- very convenient -rrb- and the food there be quite good , especially the seafood .and for three or more people , la choza 's local version of paella be worth a try .another lunch option be the pizzeria by the main pool .you best bet there , in we opinion , be the pizza .the other stuff we have there be rather forgettable .we have dinner at the italian restaurant one evening and that be a nice change - mostly for the ambiance .the food there be quite good .but again , with a 3-year-old in tow , it be not so good that be not equally happy to go to the buffet at la cana every other evening.the staff at this resort be generally very friendly and helpful , especially at the lower echelon .base on previous review , i be brace for a lengthy check-in process upon arrival -lrb- at 10 p.m. , no less -rrb- but it be fine .ok , the front desk staff seem a bit less than eager , but they be always polite .and beyond the front desk , the staff be always extremely friendly .it really do help if you try to speak a bit of spanish .they genuinely appreciate the effort.if you have child , definitely visit the petting farm and the adjacent ranch .a shuttle will be happy to take you there and pick you up again .my 3-year-old get to ride on a pony for the first time ever and that be the highlight of the week for she .: - -rrb- the kid club seem well run , though there be only two small child use it during the week we be at the resort , so it be hard to tell .and i have no other kid club experience to compare it to .but the young woman in charge seem very nice when i chat with she .-lrb- i take my daughter to play in the playground there , but she be still too young for the actual kid ' club .maybe next year .: - -rrb- the fact that this resort be not all inclusive be a bit of a inconvenience at time .daily additional expense include lunch , all beverage -lrb- except at breakfast -rrb- and most of the 脿 la carte restaurant at dinner .fortunately , you do not have to carry cash around , or even you credit card , since it all go on you tab via you room key/card , which you use like a credit card .but these separate expense do add up .then again , you do not get the heavy-drinking party type at this resort that you might elsewhere .what you do get be a nice mix of family with -lrb- usually younger -rrb- child , retiree -lrb- many of whom come for the golf -rrb- , and couple who be look for a nice quiet beach vacation .and they come from a interesting variety of place , too : france , germany , the uk , spain , italy , the we and canada , among other .we really enjoy the wide mix of nationalities.to sum up , we thoroughly enjoy we one-week stay at this resort .for we purpose , it be exactly the right choice : quiet location , beautiful beach , child-friendly environment , good food , two-bedroom + livingroom accomodation .it be not all perfect , but it be very good value for the price .we would go back again , and maybe next time we will spring for one of the beach casitas - a bit pricier but more conveniently located ."

to make this possible .not a big deal .warn !!!: there be many european there during we stay , which seem to be the time european travel more .have travel to place like australia , bali a thailand , i be use to see woman sunbathe with they top off .but i be sure most american be not .if you have kid , you may want to take note of this .the pool area be probably one of the main focal point of the

long with cheerful bartender .the pool itself be really big , go off in different direction .get a shaded spot be tough on both the beach and pool , but i do not want shade .food : in all honesty , i enjoy the buffet the best .there be so many choice to pick from and it be pretty good , in my opinion .fresh fruit , lot of cold salad , omelette station , station where they cook chicken or steak for you , pizza , pasta , rice , potato and vegetable dish .sadly i only go to breakfast once and really enjoy the breakfast .the ` fine dining ' restaurant be a little annoying .while the idea be great , they fall well short of what they aim for .they rotate which night certain one be even open .you have to go to this customer service desk and pick which night you want to eat and at what time .they stress closed shoe and pants for guy , which to I be stupid .we only make it to the american , japanese and mexican restaurant .i think i like the mexican the best .japanese be second and the american be just ... .sad .the french one be close when we be there .i hear good thing about the italian one which we fail to get to .oh , and the snack bar by the pool be good .it do the job .the pizza be really good !the roasted chicken be good too .they also have hot dog , french fries and tortilla chip with cheese saucethere be plenty of activity to try to get involve with and the animation team be pretty good at it .they work long hour everyday and have so much energy .i play a good 2 on 2 volleyball game one afternoon with one of the animation team guy and 2 european guy .i definitely would have take advantage of the tennis court and basketball court , but relaxing be just too good !there be also 2 pool table and a ping pong table near the lobby bar .we go to the disco one night .it be pretty cool inside there , and i can imagine during spring break time it be nut .there be a big dance floor in the middle with bar table seat around .i think this resort be somewhere between 3 and a half and 4 star .if it be not for the restaurant food , i would give it 4 .but food be a important part of vacation and sadly , it just be not up to par .but the grounds be wonderful , the pool be fun and the beach be great !i would really recommend this place for couple who be travel with group of friend .i would not say it be the most romantic place i have be to , but it work fine for a week getaway i suppose .but if friend be with , i think it would be a blast .tour : we take 2 tour .saona island -lrb- $ 85 pp -rrb- and santo domingo -lrb- $ 70 pp -rrb- .i have to say i be very disappointed with saona island after read so many good review .they take you to some very cool spot on the speed boat where the water be electric blue and teal and green .but the island itself do nothing for I .the rainy season definitely mean the mosquito be out and no joke , i have 5-10 bite on my back while go up to get something to drink once .you be fine in the sun on the beach , but when you have to go into the tree where the food/drink be , be careful .i be sure it be fine in the dry season .we really enjoy santo domingo .i be fascinate see other city and culture so this trip be great .it be a very long day though ... .we leave the resort at 6:25 and do not get back until 8:30 .it be over 3 hour to get to santo domingo from punta cana , but the tour guide do a pretty good job

0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,"not worth the money i be write a long review , so if you be busy , here be the bottom line : there be better deal than this hotel.when i make a reservation in a world famous hilton resort hotel chain , pay a certain amount of money , there be a certain expectation , but this hotel do not meet my expectation.first impression : my first impression of this hotel be that it be old and crowded .i see wear and tear , here and there , although we room in the tower seem new.location : the location be good for old san juan and ashford avenue , and about one hour or more one-way drive to the biobay , scuba diving , ferry for vieque , or el yunque , which be ok.however , it be not easy to find a market or a restaurant nearby.room and tower : we tower room be nice and new.our bed throw have black spot here and there , which i strongly suspect as mold , so we never use the throw .other bedding stuff be good and comfortable.the bathroom do not have a bathtub and ventilation , which be a minus , but have a nice shower system with good hot water pressure.no minibar , which translate to a free empty refrigerator.the tower do not have any security , so anyone from the street could go in and out freely .also it be a little bit away from the private beach or the swimming pool.beach and swimming area : the swimming pool be ok but do not look as good as other resort hotel ' pool i visit include other hilton although it do not matter for I because i spend time not in the pool but on the beach.the private beach be good and safe for child as it be protect by a breakwater or something .there be some float thing to climb up and enjoy , and a sunbathe balcony on the sea .although it be crowd , we have a good time on the beach.food : everything be overprice .one bottle of bud light will cost you $ 8 + tax + tip .a mcdonald quality hamburger be $ 13 + tax + tip at a bar , and it be the cheapest snack you can get in the hotel except starbuck , which be the only place with reasonable price in this hotel.if the food quality be good , we would not complain about the price because we be on vacation and ready to spend some .however , we do not want to pay that money for this quality of food , so we always drive out to eat and to shop for the next day 's breakfast.btw , this hotel claim that its pool bar be the birth place of the pina colada .if you want to try it , it be $ 13 + tax + tips.staff : most of the staff be friendly and nice except for the front desk manager .the concierge be so helpful , and even house keeper be always smile although they be not good at english .however , when i be in trouble , the front desk manager be very unhelpful and give I a why-should-i-be-bothered-about-your-fault attitude .how she neglect I really astounded I .fee , parking , internet , etc : you need to pay the additional resort fee -lrb- about 13 or 14 % -rrb- even if you already pay for you room.everything cost you money .i already write about the overpriced food .parking also cost like $ 15 a day , and the parking garage be not connect to the hotel facility which be very bad while rain .internet be also like $ 15 a day .although they say the wireless internet on the lobby be free , we could not get the signal at the lobby and end up pay the money to get the wire access.overall , i be willing to re-visit puerto rico , especially to do the biobay tour again , but i would not stay at this hotel next time ."

2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,"great !i will post this review under both the ifa villa and ifa village as they be part of the same resort complex.overall this resort be above average and i would rate it a four out of five.my girlfreind and i -lrb- both 27 -rrb- arrive on jan 29 and stay until feb 5 , 2007 .facility : upon arrival they put we in the villa section , room 1089 , i ask they if they could move we closer to the beach and they say they would have a room in the 4000 block on the 31st .the villa section be quite a way away from the beach .the higher you room number in the 1000 block the further away you be .overall my room in the villa section be a little run down compare to the room i be give later in the 4000 block .i the worst problem be the shower -lrb- no tub -rrb- be very low flow and take a long time for the water to turn hot .also the refrigerator do not seem to cool very well even on high .the tv have no remote and the front door do not seem very secure .i would recommend everyone to rent a safe -lrb- $ 3 dollar a day -rrb- the villa overall wuold be good for someone who would prefere a quiet location pool site rather then a crowded beach .or the foot traffic of the other more central pools.the main stage , 3 al cart restaurant , a pool bar and captain lounge be all located in the villa section .the 2 buffet restaurant be located in the other part of the complex so they be bit of a walk to get to.on the january 31 we move to we room in the 4000 block in the ocean village section -lrb- 4036 -rrb- .the room overall be in much better shape the we other room in the villa the biigest improvement be the flow of the shower .the tv have a remote and as we be on the third flow we have a balcony .we be now only a short walk from the beach.the beach be great but make sure you wake up early and put a towel on a chair .many day we sleep in and could not find a empty chair and have to go over the barcelo section of beach.find the stage and stay away from it if you prefer quite as they like to blast the music.i find the grounds be very well keep and securefoodoverall the food be very good .you could aways get something to eat from 7 be to 3am .the buffet offer a abundance of different food .they always have someone on the grill cooking something .my personal favorite be breakfast , the cook woould prepare a omelette for you from a assortment of ingredient for you selection .my only complaint would be that sometime the waiter or waitress would take too long to get my drink and i would be finish eating by the time it arrive .i only eat at the international a la carte restaurant so i can not comment on the other two .many day i would grab a slice of pizza from the snack bar beside the pool in the village section.the disco -lrb- afterhour at the beach bar -rrb- be somewhat of a disappointment as it be not very well attend .but you can go there to grab a bite to eat up until 3am .staff and entertainmentoverall the staff be very freindly .i never have any problem get a drink .sometime i would go up to the bar and be ask what i want by three different bartender while the fourth be alreadty prepare my order .if you be sit at a table the waitress can take some time come around so i would have to go to the bar to get another drink .-lrb- no big deal -rrb- the animation team -lrb- entertainment -rrb- be very good and they try to keep you entertain .atmospherethe week i be there the resort be mostly attend by couple and european tourist -lrb- mostly french -rrb- .although i do see many different combination , group of woman , group of man , some family etc i would definitely go back again ."

2,2,2,2,2,1,0,2,"absolutely fabulous !!spend a week at the majestic from 4/17 through 4/24 .here be the high and the low : airport be probably the worst run i have ever see - no organization , hundred of people swarm with no rope to form line , no idea of where to go or what to do .once through immigration find one of we bag be miss - try to communicate with a airport rep and fill out a form .miraculously the bag arrive at the hotel at the end of the day - sheer luck !we arrange transportation through expedia and have no problem there .the only annoying thing be that they could not tell I what time they would be pick we up at the hotel for the way back .i be force to go meet the rep at the hotel 3 time before they could give I that info.arrived at the hotel around 1:30 - the 2 room be not ready so we go for lunch at the buffet .finally get the room around 3:30 and they be next to each other but not pool view .also , one of the room have a terrible musty odor .i go to the front desk to try and switch room but they say the hotel be full .they promise to send someone right away to wash the room and try to eliminate the odor .well after call three more time no one ever show up so we just give up .eventually as the weather dry up the smell go away .the room be big and comfortable with awesome air conditioning .the shower be huge but the toilet area be a little small .there be a few too many mosquito for my taste but that be to be expect in the tropics - just a few bite on the kid , or so i think ... next day my 8 year old wake up with he eye completely swollen shut !we take he to the 24 hour medical clinic on site .the woman doctor there be very kind and helpful and give he a shot of something that bring the swell down after 24 hour .a little unnerving but the response be comforting.the food : all the food be better than i expect .i be not a fan of buffet but how else could they feed all these people economically ?the breakfast be unbelievable - fresh juice , egg , omelett , pancake , waffle , bread , roll , crepe , yogurt , fruit shake , etc. but the best thing be the freshly make churro - nothing like the mushy one you get in the we !i eat at least 4 every morning .and the coffee ?best i have ever have .the lunch be a little limited - 2 buffet - one on the beach and the breakfast one .dinner be a choice of the breakfast buffet where they have italian , or the other sit down restaurant - mexican , steakhouse , seafood , japanese and gourmet where only 12 and up can go .all be pretty good but the menu be small and not child friendly .initially my 8 and 10 year old do not eat anything because there be no chicken tender or mac and cheese .but guess what ?since they be hungry they try new thing and now they both like steak !pasta be only available at the main buffet for dinner .the dessert be also fantastic - a different variety every night .the chocolate cake be the best and they always have a ice cream bar - you must try the coconut ice cream - it be so delicious !believe I , we do not go hungry .my daughter do get diarrhea from the 3rd day until we get home but the rest of be be ok .i try to not drink too many of the tasty frozen drink just in case.now the reason i rate this a 5 : the beach and the pool .i have be on many vacation and these be by far the very best i have ever see .the pool be so big that it never seem crowded and it be clean all the time .the temperature be perfect and the ledge in the water be ingenious for sunbathe .i do not want to leave .since there be so much grass and vegetation around the pool you do not feel like you be in a hotel - it feel like paradise .the beach be also beautiful - the softest sand i have ever feel .the water be clear and blue although not as calm as i would have like .and i have to say that this be the only beach in the caribbean that i have be to that do not have the annoying local try to sell you hair braid and jewelry - what a wonderful change!the kid club be a little dull but my kid only go to hang out with other kid so it be ok for they for a couple of day .at the beach and pool every day they bring a different animal for people to pose with and then purchase the picture for $ 10 a piece .a little pricey but i be glad i buy all 8 of they - a python , 2 different monkey , 2 macaw and a iguana - pretty cool for the kids.we go to a couple of the show but they be a little cheesy .i try the casino and that be fun - win a little money too .the nightlife be not fantastic but we be happy to relax in the room and read or watch tv .want to get up early anyway to enjoy the outdoors.all in all this be a great vacation if you can get past the little annoying thing .i have be on cruise and to other caribbean island but for a family of 5 this be the best value around .if you want to relax and sit by the pool and the beach this be the place for you !"

very few usa network channel , but i think they have fox .i know they have cnn and a few movie channel .do not matter to we , hardly watch tv.activities .no daily schedule of activity give out , no pool volleyball or game , no dance lesson , etc. this be strictly a sit-by-the-pool-or-beach type of place .we would have like more to do.sports .tennis court look nice , no one ever use themsport bar .have the nhl package and a bunch of tv and will look for any game you want.casino - only walk through .blackjack table be a minimum of $ 5 or 100 peso , so if you want to play $ 3 blockjack , go to the village and use the atm to get peso , or exchange dollar for peso at one of the exchanges.although my report might seem negative , i think it be more of a reflection on what i view as the lack of customer service mentality at a all-inclusive resort in the dominican republic .we meet a couple from canada on we last night in the sport bar who be only stay here one night .they go on and on about how much better this resort be than the place they be at next door for 14 day !they tell we about bathtub that do not drain , bad room , bad food , line at bar , etc. so i guess it be all in you perspective .maybe all-inclusive be not for we ."

2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2,"clean we just come home from two week in oahu .we stay at the equus after have it recommend by expedia at the last minute .we originally have book in another hotel closer to the beach that refuse to accomodate what we pay for with expedia - so we transferred.the equus be a quaint smaller hotel of approx .100 room .there be no ocean view but possibly a marina view from some of the higher floor in the front corner room .the front desk staff be very friendly and helpful and be able to answer any question we had.the room be very clean and comfortable .we have a queen bed in a canopy make of bamboo which be very cool and just what you would expect for hawaius .the room have a great refrigerator/freezer combo and granite countertop in both the room and bathroom .no tub but stand up shower make of tumbled granite which be fine for we .the bed be very comfortable and slide door lead to a lanai with city view .we also have a terrific flat screen tv in we room on the wall .so much better than other hotel with the old tv nail to the bureau.the hotel also have free internet right through the tv with a wireless keyboard and mouse right in the room , which be fantastic .a very cool bonus and completely handy .for those who need something print they have a complete setup in the lobby at .20 cent a min .+ .35 print per page , but it be well worth the convenience .we love be able to check email , check bus route on thebus.org before we head out for the day .this be a fabulous perk to stay with the equus.additionally , the hotel offer a nice continental breakfast each morning of coffee , orange or guava juice , fruit cocktail , fresh whole fruit and a variety of roll , muffin , etc. very nice and great touch.the downside to stay at this hotel first be the location .while it be very convenient to the ala moana shopping center and bus route , the only beach option be to cut across the hilton hawaiian village and use that beach or take the bus down to waikikus .if you be to walk to the waikiki beach it would take 20-30 minute .we do it but be hot by the time we get there .we ultimately use the hilton beach most day .also , the street noise be very loud .we do not get a good night sleep any of the night because of the noise from the street .there be little the hotel can do for this so take ear plug unless you be use to city noise .there be no laundry facility at this hotel , they recommend you walk to the aqua condo building behind the hotel and go to they 3rd floor coin operate laundry , however when we do this there be 3 people wait there for they laundry and be use the 2 work machine .so we haul we laundry down the street to a laundromat .the elevator in this hotel be handy , however we have serious rain on we trip and it seem the elevator go out of service in heavy rain .this make it necessary for we to walk up to we room and count the flight of stair to the lobby then up to we 7th floor room it be a bit of a pain .this would have present a major problem for anyone with a infirmity or major handicap.finally , the pool .the pool be very well maintained but small with a heavy rush of move water in the middle .i never once see anyone in it .it be border on all side by building and be not invite .pretty to look at but not functional , as a matter of fact i do not notice if it have stair , however i do not go close to look.i would recommend the equus for a clean nice place to stay , but if you be look to spend every day at the beach with little effort you would be better off pay a bit more to stay closer .if you be on business this be perfect since you be close to the convention center , ala moana and the free internet in the room.overall we enjoy we stay at the equus and the benefit far outweigh the downside .compare to the hotel we be initially book in it be light year better .it be everything a boutique hotel should be ."

a deluxe junior suite with jacuzzi .when we arrive at the hotel , we would just beat a major afternoon downpour .as other have mention , to check into the royal service , they have to truck you out to the royal service check in area , which be a short five-minute drive from the main building .by the time we have wait 20 minute for someone to take we out there , it be pour , so we hop onto a tarp-covered and soak wet passenger cart and speed through six inch deep pool of water try to keep at least we top-half dry by hold the plastic down as we go .they can not control the weather , but they could do better in keep people dry .frankly , the whole idea of a separate check-in may be exciting for some , but i would rather arrive and be show right to my room to settle in - i can get orient later.we slosh into the royal service check in area and be meet with blank stare when we tell they the name on we reservation - when book through orbitz or another online agency , make sure you print out you voucher .fortunately , i have my blackberry and be able to show they we reservation - tell they we reservation number be not good enough , and i be fairly convince they would have throw we out if we have not show they the email .after a hour of check in -lrb- much of it wait for someone to pay attention to we , then for we room to be ready -rrb- , we also book some reservation at a couple of the restaurant for the next few day -lrb- we will return to that later -rrb- .back into the rain and to we soak transportation , all the way across the property to a room on the far side .the room be large , damp , cold and uncomfortably furnished .the bed be hard and there be only a thin polyester blanket and some worn sheet , which be as damp as the rest of the room .it do not have a electronic safe , so i ask the porter to bring a lock for the old-fashioned safe to put away we valuable - it arrive the next night -lrb- after a complaint in the morning -rrb- and a second lock arrive the next morning -lrb- more on that later -rrb- .for kick back and relax during the day , it be wonderful - we enjoy breakfast and lunch at the royal service dining room .the royal service pool and beach be clean and relaxing , and the bartender be generally very friendly .i should note that there be a lot of smoker at and near the pool bar - i use to smoke regularly and still sometimes smoke on vacation , so it do not bother I , but i be sure other will be turn off by that.we hit the gym one day , which be decently appoint and have mostly work machine and a reasonable selection of free weight .we also schedule time on the tennis court and have a good time hit some ball around - the guy tend the court be extremely friendly.i have wait too long to remember all of the detail of we dinner fiasco -lrb- plural -rrb- , but the gist of it be that we call on we first evening to change we reservation for the follow day and be confirm .that day we be suppose to receive a reservation voucher to bring to the restaurant - by the time we get back to we room that evening , it be nowhere to be find .we call to complain and be tell they do not have any record of we reservation -lrb- neither we original one nor the new one -rrb- .we trek over to the royal service area to complain and , lo and behold , be meet with blank stare again .the worst thing be that the staff do not apologize and try to make thing right , they just get defensive .the only thing we ever hear from they be we have no reservation for you - you have to reserve in advance , you can not just call right before .even that would have be ok , if they have just preface it with a i be sorry , but that be something we do not hear the entire time we be there .i be a pretty nice guy - my fiancee make fun of I because i do not complain and i overtip even for bad service .perhaps i be not forceful enough , but i have to say that on the day we check out the guy at the next desk be virtually scream at they -lrb- after a half hour of fairly calm argue -rrb- and get basically the same reaction i get with my calm explanation that they have screw up .finally , as a consolation prize , they give we a 6-ish reservation for the restaurant -lrb- the japanese place -rrb- for the follow night , and we clearly only get that because someone else have cancel - still no apology .all that say , we should have avoid the finer dining place altogether .the japanese place , as i be sure other have note , be a benihana style joint that be basically fry rice and teriyaki .i be a pretty huge sushi fan , but i have to say that you should stay far away from the terrible sushi - if you have ever have sushi before , it will be upset - if you have never have sushi before -lrb- as many at we table have not -rrb- , it will make you wonder what kind of lunatic would ever eat the stuff .we cancel we reservation at the french place , as we hear pretty terrible thing about that as well .my suggestion for food be to stick with the latin theme place - the mexican and brazilian joint be both perfectly good and exactly what we expect .no surprise and a better selection.the bar near the royal service pool be lovely at night - softly light , not crowd but full enough to have a nice hum about the place and lot of laughter .the casino be a little depressing - bright fluorescent light and a few table , each with a couple of people who be a little too serious about they gambling consider the setting.we only go to one entertainment event , in the restaurant area/indoor bar down by the beach .it be a little odd to say the least .it be kind of a rave atmosphere - i can not remember what the theme be - but it have a sort of depraved thing go on .there be female go-go dancer type on raise platform and a oil and well-muscled man in nothing but a speedo , roller skate and sunglass roller-dance through the joint and grab delighted middle-aged woman to dance with .the strangest thing be that there be all these kid there , range from 10 to maybe 16 year old - people have bring they family down for a little entertainment , and the kid be dance around in strobe light next to these grind , provocatively dress staff member .think back to when i be 13 or 14 , i probably would have think it be pretty awesome to dance around with a bunch of hot , scantily clad dominican woman , but at 30 -lrb- which be pretty young as adult at that place go -rrb- this be just surreal and disturbing .clearly there be parent there - some be dance with they kid .i will confess i have fun just watch the strange scene , and i be sure many of the more traditional show with musical number , etc. be more appropriate for the family and senior who be the majority of the guests.finally , we check out -lrb- we stay 3 night -rrb- .we ask to have we bag bring around and to close out we bill .here we come back to that matter of the safe lock .i leave the lock attach to the safe with the key in it and the safe open -

i be a lawyer , and while i be not fluent in spanish or dr law , the release have a english translation and unless dr law be crazy , the release would have completely cover they for liability if i leave something behind .finally , i agree to go to the room , i get on the back of the security chief 's scooter , schlep all the way to the room , look at the safe , take out the lock and hand it to the security chief , sign the release , and schlep back to my wait fiancee .thank god we plan to get to the airport very early , because this would potentially have make we miss we flight if we have let if get much closer.so , if you have read this far , you be probably ask how i can even give the place two star .answer ?if i know what it be go in , i probably would not have find the experience so frustrating .you need to go there expect very little and you will probably come away with a much better experience , both objectively and subjectively .plan to go and sit on the beach or by the pool , eat mexican or dominican food , and try not to rely on the property to do anything for you .if you can do that and get a good deal on price , it will be fine .the setting be lovely , the people be -lrb- for the most part -rrb- friendly , and there be free food and drink .good enough , i would say ."

the bavaro side of the resort -rrb- and the japanese mikado -lrb- on the punta cana side -rrb- be close !!customer service now admit that those two restaurant be just close this week and that suddenly there be a cancellation at the dominican restaurant located in the club premier section of the resort !we never succede in get a third a la carte restaurant and i believe the resort be limit the amount of people in the restaurant as a measure of cost control .send everyone to the buffet be much more profitable for them.the quality of food at the two a la carte 's be very good compare to the

free to guest so that they could sell a lesson?lounge chair at beach and pool : forget about try to find a lounge chair at the beach or the main pool at 8:30 be on monday because of , you guess it , too many guest .here 's another unique trick ... guest be arrive at the pool and beach early morning and instead of reserve a lounge chair by place one towel lengthwise per chair , they be actually place they towel across two chair , widthwise , thereby reserve twice the number of chair at the beach and at the pool.guess what we start do early tuesday be !status at other resort : during the week , my wife and i walk up and down the beach to check out other resort .the majestic -lrb- 5 * -rrb- , just north of gbp , have 50 % of the lounge chair available at the beach and next to they pool .the

very clean .no cockroach be see and they have a regular pest control company come to ensure that there be no bug -lrb- they actually come while we be there -rrb- .bathroom floor could have use a darn good scrubbing though.also many of the unit be privately own and some be rent out by absentee owner who do not all provide daily cleaning service through the hotel and that may be why some unit have report of cockroaches.hotel lobby be immaculate as be all the public area , include the laundry room , and sauna .the convenience shop be currently for sale and it do not carry a lot but there be liquor and basics and the ever present abc store -lrb- all block cover -rrb- .the hot tub be very hot and they have sign post that child under 14 be not allow -lrb- even with a parent -rrb- but anyone with a hot tub know that high temperature be very dangerous to small child .security actually have camera on the pool deck and have some parent remove they child from the hot tub , for they own health and safety.some of the lounge on the pool deck be in need of repair as some of the strapping be miss however i think they may be replaced/repaired when the pool deck be clean and pool tile repair as part of the renovation.there be no restaurant in the hotel but there be plenty close by , such as denny 's , ihop , and we favorite be the cheesecake factory in the royal hawaiian shopping centre and the wailana coffe house -lrb- take the bus it be worth it -rrb- .they do have a enterprize car rental agency and if you find the right tourist information book which be on every corner , you can save 15 % .parking for guest be $ 14.00 per 24 hour period which be really cheap for waikikus .on street parking be non existent at night and during the day you have to feed the meter and it be only for a max of 2 hours.overall we experience be above average with the exception of the construction.if you be consider the island colony you should contact they directly to get a update of they renovation schedule before make you decision.we be look forward to see what other renovation will take place before we return there again.p.s .most of the photo you see on the internet and in brochure be the original photo from when it open in 1978-79 .so look at the more recent photo that people have post ."

they house to bring you picture and flower .i give a few of they a dollar , but wish we would have know to give they something else .check in be smooth and you do get they punch and a cool washcloth which you will need after you very bumpy ride to the resort .every resort i have be to have do the same thing though .it take about 45 minute as you have to drop everyone else off and this be one of the last resort .my advice would be be to get you own taxi to and from so you do not have to wait .friend that we meet pay 33 usd at night from the airport which be higher than they daytime fee .the conceirge service in the lobby be helpful , polite , take we to we room right away with we luggage .we do get the fruit basket , 1 small bottle of rum , 1 small box of 3 cigar , and the towel decorate

the review i expect way more than what be speak about .the tex-mex filet mignon i receive be tough but my husband 's be cook just right but not anything to brag about .the plate always come out hot and so will you caesar salad .this be really the only salad to speak of here at the resort .everytime you get a drink , make sure you ask for you glass to be fill with ice or you will be drink hot whatever you drink .this be throughout the resort .il bacio , the italian restaurant be way below average .i end up get sick after eat the smallest portion of lasagna i have ever be serve .they do serve my husband a second piece to compensate for he be able to eat it in 4 bite .we friend say they have enjoy it there and get big help of the ravioli and fettucinus .we never eat at the fondue but

margarita be nasty and they do not even carry any name brand tequila .the animation team be just plain annoy .the same stupid dancing and yell of applauso throughout the day at the pool make you not want to be there .we have we everyday player for volleyball in the pool which be fun except we have to fight the animation team to get a decent ball everyday to play .then once we be out there , they harrass we to do they activity which we do not want to do , so they would come over into we game and try to take over .the gift shop be way over price compare to anything else .if you want to get deal you must go down to the beach about 1 mile to the left .you must heavily barter to get a cheapy cheapy price .they will give you the calculator and tell you what do you want to pay .we always end up pay half of what they be ask .do not pay more than 5 dollar for any shirt or hat .coffee should be around $ 6 and windchime $ 20 .painting $ 20-30 medium size .make sure you bring pants and dress shoe

2,2,1,-1,2,-1,2,-1,"great place for all !my family and i just return from a two-week holiday at the iberostar punta cana .i fly out of jfk on a non-stop american airline flight .it be great !the plane be not crowd .i travel with my husband and two child age 2.4 and 1.1 year .both child do not get much sleep the night before .they both fall asleep about one hour into the flight .lucky I !the plane arrive half hour early at 11:00 a.m. once you exit the plane the hot and humid air hit you right in the face !it be a smooth exit from the airport .i be one step ahead of the game because i purchase my tourist card at the consulate in new york and have they already fill out .i head straight for custom .my bag come right away .i do not have ground transportation to and from the airport .i be tell you can grab a cab as soon as you exit .the advice be correct.i have a air-conditioned van for $ 24 usd .the ride to the hotel be a little scary .however , i wasn鈥檛 surprise because the road be similar to my grandparent city of coamo , puerto rico .go towards the hotel in pc there be two lane .one go and the other come .if you want to pass the very slow move vehicle in front you would have to go into the oncoming traffic lane to pass the vehicle .this be scary .however the dominican be use to drive like this so i wasn鈥檛 concern .i be also not surprise on how some of the poor people live .the housing be call shanty-towns 鈥淢ake shift homes鈥 ?i be familiar with this because i travel to rio and the poor people live like the same .well to get off the subject and on to the hotel.of course there be only one person at the reception and he last name happen to be ruiz which be my mother last name .he speak english but i speak in spanish .i give the guy $ 30 to upgrade I to a junior suite .i could have give he less because he didn鈥檛 even ask for money .the junior suite be nice but it be not conveniently located .the junior suite be located near the front entrance of the property .the front entrance be close to the buffet and japanese restaurant .the suite have double or king size bed with a small table and chair a sofa and a very nice bathroom with a big tub .the downside of this location be that it be a far walk to the pool and beach .not a big deal if i be marry with no kid .but shelp beach stuff with two kid in toe be difficult .the same day i go to the front desk and ask to speak with the manager .the manager鈥檚 name be mr. coleman .he be a very nice gentleman and have a way with word !i guess that be why he manage鈥檚 all three hotel punta cana , dominicana , and bavaro .i ask if there be anyway he can get I a standard room closer to the beach .he pleasantly advise to come and see he the next day around 2:00 p.m. and he will see what he can do .well patience pay off because he give we a family suite !the family suite be locate on the second floor hop skip and jump from the pool area.the suite be two room .the first have a king size bed , sofa bed , tv and bathroom .the other connect room have two double bed w / a tv .both room have a patio with table and two chair .it be really nice .i also ask for a crib it be clean and it serve the purpose .the decore be a little outdated but the room serve the purpose .pool beach foodthere be two pool side by side one for dominicana and the other for punta cana .they be a good size but would have like a bigger pool .but then again who go to the carribean to sit in a pool .the sun be strong to the pool water get warm .there be a lot of space for kid to place .there be also a baby pool .the pool be keep very clean .the first week of arrival be not crowd so i do not need to reserve a sun shade .as the week past i find i have to wake up in the morning for the prime spot .only because i have kid .the beach be absolutely beautiful .this be where i spend my entire vacation .i set up shop on the first row of hut .so i be two step from the pool and two step from the beach and right between the beach buffet !the front of the dominicana pool be the activity side .they have lot of game provide by the wonderful star friend .i dance merengue and my 2 year old sun do too !the ice cream at the la cana be way better than the la yola icecream stand .the la cana have rotisseree chicken that be great better than the other buffet .but the buffet near the dominicana have frenchfry with cheese , rice and bean , etc. more of a selection.food and restaurantsi be pleasantly surprise that the food be pretty decent .i mean come on you be in the dominican republic not nyc !the buffet be a open air restaurant so you will see fly .some people freak out .they be not swarm all over the food .they basically annoy you at the table .i have a great tip .take a napkin and place it over you food while you be eat .leave a small opening .no fly will come .it work .i do this the entire week .people must have think i be crazy .i have low expectation of the food and bring every medication in god creation .i only get sick once for a 陆 day take ammodium ad pill and walla it be go !at the buffet they have steak make to order .rice , vegee , pork , pasta , pizza , etc. i stay away from the salad but i find everything be temperature control .i find they check the temperature of the cold food often , which be a good thing .the be constantly clean up .first couple of day i tip the waiter for get I water and soda but it be easier just to get it myself so i stop tip after the first week .another tip be to make sure you eat you food well do .the pork shoulder be cook well .but the little cut of meat -lrb- steak -rrb- be not cook well .they just brown the meat to meet the demand of people .just ask the cook to cook it more well do and you won鈥檛 get sick .this be why i have to take ammmodium ad because i eat a raw piece of steak.a lot of people get sick because they drink too many of those frozen drink .the frozen drink be very sweet .especially the coconut one ; these be pure laxative !hey if you drink in the sun and eat a lot you will get sick !i meet a couple from pa and he be drink lot of rum .i say to he that you better slow down buddy you will get sick .he say nahh !i drink all the time and sure enough he be in the room the entire day sick as a dog with diareara .lucy鈥檚 clubthis club be for child 4-12 ?the club be small but they do have lot鈥檚 of game , movie and various indoor/outdoor activity .there be a staff of two .during the crowded point of my stay i see about 12 child walk from one activity to another .there be one girl in the front and one in the back make sure everyone play follow the leader .the girl understand english quite well but speak a little english .they do a great job at the mini disco which be hold nightly .it鈥檚 repetitous but that鈥檚 because they want the kid to follow they .they march , dance and do play skit .it鈥檚 really cute .my son love the mini disco even though he be only 2.4 .he dance around the stage by himself at time !and tucker himself out that when we go back to the room he fall asleep really fast .it be wonderful !the girl work really hard because again this be not there end of the day .they start at 10am and work until 10 pm .that鈥檚 a long day .make sure you tip they .one of the girl live in santo domingo and go home every 11 days!i would recommend this resort for everyone .it鈥檚 a great chain .if you like to party stay on the domincana side .if you like peace and quite stay on the punta cana .remember the dominicana side have everything from the show , casino , etc. rude peoplebefore departure i read numerous post about people be rude -lrb- ie .american and european -rrb- .i always have a open mind when i be on vacation because who want to argue ?well that statement be short live .i guess because i be one week and five day into my vacation and the buffet be get to I .i be stand in front of a dish that have one hot dog leave .i have a plate in my hand with three hot dog bun -lrb- mind you my son be hungry -rrb- .a gentleman be use the thong to pick up a piece of steak .i be wait for those thong because i have proper etiquette .well long behold this french guy behind I -lrb- who see that i be wait for

dog and he pretend that he didn鈥檛 speak english .well since he do that my husband go up to he and tell he he be a -- .i know he understand because a few minute later he be sit one table away speak english to he friend .go figure .the buffet at lunch be like go to a high school cafeteria .everyone for themselves .well that be my experience at the buffet ."

2,2,2,2,2,1,0,-1,"good value for family , but caution advise ... we spend five night at the york at the end of july , and overall have a positive experience .the location be ideal -- within walk distance to the rock and circular quay .we deluxe two bedroom 2 bath on the 21st floor have a decent partial view of the harbor bridge -- a advance request that the hotel staff kindly accommodate .have a kitchen with all the amenity help cut down some of we family 's food budget , at least for breakfast .the room be nicely renovate , though we be not thrill with the choice of art and the extensive use of red in all furnishings .my only real beef be with the staff , who be not rude per se , but also not terribly pleasant or helpful either .you should especially be very very careful before sign you credit card slip at the check-out .they show I my bill , which i examine and say it be fine .subsequently they take my credit card to run it through , hand I the slip and in one breath , ask I to sign .thankfully , by some divine intervention , i look at the amount just before sign it , only to discover to my horror that it be $ 600 over the amount that be on my final bill !the young lady at the desk do not even apologize when i point it out to she .she simply say , oh , let I change that for you .meanwhile i could partly see she co-worker/supervisor in the background watch and listen to what be go on .i will give they the benefit of the doubt and assume that it be not intentional or a organize plot .all i be say be , be careful , and review all charge and total before you sign .otherwise , enjoy the great location and request a higher floor to avoid the noise ."

2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,"nice little getaway we stay at the tapatio cliff resort for one night after christmas as a getaway from the family and it be very worthwhile overall .we call ahead to ask for and receive a early check-in , which allow we additional time to make use of some of the resort ' facility .this be a very nice touch , since check-in be usually at 4 pm , which limit how much you can enjoy a place on a one-night stay.we think the room be quite spacious and clean overall , with warm , yet modern decorative finish .the bed be wonderful .there be only one vanity for the bathroom , which be located across a hallway from the water closet itself .the light switch for the water closet be on the outside wall , which be little awkward .the separate living room be fine , but the sofa be stiff and there be no coffee table to set a drink on .it would also have be helpful for the room to have a refrigerator separate from the mini-bar like some other resort have be know to provide .-lrb- we would hear mixed review about the different point of view restaurant and decide instead to stay in with food wine from the aj 's fine food store located north of the resort at 7th st. thunderbird , which be a excellent store and turn out to be a excellent choice !no fridge mean mean creative use of the sink and ice bucket for we wine , cheese and sushi .ce la vie ! -rrb-although it be in the 50s-low 60 the day we stay at tc , we decide that it be still worth a trip to the water park / pool .-lrb- when you come from the 10s 20s , 50s 60 be quite a warm-up ! -rrb-this area be pretty well remove from the vast majority of the guest room and almost need to be drive to because of the lack of walk along most of the interior drive .the pool facility be very nice and very welcome and the cascade bar be also good .there be a smaller pool / spa / workout room in the center of the main guest room area , though it look largely close while we be there.one area i would caution guest to be the point in tyme restaurant , which be located near the main pool area .we go for breakfast before check out and it be a disaster .the service be abysmal and the food neither worth the wait or the price -lrb- 45 minute and $ 13 for huevo ranchero ! -rrb-.this be noteworthy because it be definitely not high season when we be there , so i can only imagine what a treat it be in peak times.overall , i would recommend a stay at tapatio cliff .my wife and i would definitely have stay another night if we schedule would have allow and hope to get back for another stay the next time we be in phoenix .i should note that the resort be in the final stage of a renovation project , which currently have the main lobby gut and move to temporary quarter elsewhere in the main building .some of the parking around the main building be tear up or use as staging , but it be not a big deal overall and i would not let it dissuade you from stay at the tc ."

0,1,1,2,0,2,0,-1,"a terrible disappointment let I just start by say that this be we first trip to san francisco .my husband and i decide to ditch the east coast when it come to we vacation this summer and go to sunny california .i have some expectation of this hotel , but not to many give the fact that i have speak twice to they concierge , ken prior to we arrival and both time he be dismissive and rude .i be try to arrange some activity prior to we arrival and he tell I that i do n`t need to book anything in advance -lrb- never mind the fact that i do n`t want to spend my vacation plan my daily activity , hence i be try to do it in advance -rrb- and when i ask about different tour company that organize day trip outside of san francisco , he describe one of they and let I know that it be for outdoorsy people -lrb- you think ? -rrb-and he didnt care much for be in the car for 3 hour on the way to the american river .i actually think about move we reservation to another hotel , but it be too late.the hotel itself be very old , but it do have a lot of charm .the lobby have somewhat of a feeling of grandeur but the year of neglect can easily be notice .the check-in be pleasant , the front desk interaction be amongst the few pleasurable one we have while we be there .the room be very small and very contrasting in what the decor and upgrade be concern -lrb- the front desk upgrade we at check-in because we room be not ready - i do n`t want to see the room we be initially in if this be a upgrade -rrb- .the room have new curtain , new headboard -lrb- with some very suspicious stain on it -rrb- , a large flat screen tv , 1 night stand , 1 desk and chair .the bathroom seem remodel -lrb- new vanity and commode -rrb- until you pull back the shower curtain and you see the old stain , chip bathtub .overall cleanliness - ok anyway , the room be less important because we spend most of the time sightseeing.the concierge staff at the hotel be still rude and dismissive during we stay so we try to stay clear of they and on we departure day we call 4 time to arrange for transportation to the airport , leave a voicemail and never hear back from they .every time we would call the hotel operator to let they know that we be try to get a hold of the concierge and they keep transfer we to the same extension that we have already call and that nobody answer .we finally go downstairs and we be inform by a patronize ken -lrb- same one as above -rrb- that arrange airport transportation require for we to be physically present at he desk -lrb- which no one have mention during we repeat transfer call -rrb- and that he be extremely busy right as he walk in so he have not yet be able to return we call -lrb- although when we arrive at he desk he be not even there and we have to ask the fd to get he from the back area -rrb- .the conclusion ... .i have n`t stay at any other hotel in san francisco but i the next time i ` m in sf i will gladly try another one .sir franci drake be not bad , and certainly the physical imperfection could have be overlook if the staff be spectacular .but ..."

2,2,0,1,2,2,2,0,"try the mamajuana !its fantastic !my girlfriend and i just return from the warmth of punta cana , we stay at the lti resort and beach club in punta cana .i will get right to the point , the room be definately nothing to write home about , there be part of the ceiling miss , crack in the tile shower , the tv rarely work and it you attempt to fix it you receive a shock .somehow a lizzard become a roommate of ours , it didnt cause problem but ive never have one in my room before .another thing i find odd be that they come to fumigate you room during you stay at least once , although you may be tempt to tell they to wait , i be surprise at the dead bug i find in the room before the maid have a chance to clean they up after fumigation .that part aside the resort itself be very nice , very lush with big beautiful tree , shrub etc. all throughout the ground , the pool be great , the beach be awesome , there be plenty of chair but if you want one under a hut get up early , they be the first to go .the food end be average , although we never do try the a-la-carte ' resturant which be include , the buffett offer something for everyone taste 3 time a day .drink be awesome , there be a wide variety and the beer be very good .one thing i would say be a draw back for sure would be the folk from the ceyna beach club , which share the main resort grounds with the ltus .they set up at the only entrance to the buffet dining area and be quite pushy to entice you to visit the resort .basically similar to timeshare thing at other resort but these guy harp you 3 time a day , every day .i have one guy literally chase after I one day because the night before i make the mistake of say maybe tomorrow .tell they no and keep walk , they should get the point after a couple days.if you be look for a place with other canadian presesnt there , this may not be the one for you .lot , and lot of german people , many other european .a little different when you be use to mexico.overall , the 4 star rating this hotel have would be accurate in my opinion .we have a wonderfull time and for the price we pay , we get more than we money worth .* try the mamajuana , its fantastic *"
0,0,0,-1,2,-1,0,-1,"construction on monmouth noisy we think the covent garden hotel be a very ordinary hotel .it do not live up to we expectation and certainly do not live up to the hundred of unusually positive accolade we have read from other ` traveler ' and travel expert .the vast majority of review we read be overwhelmingly positive .we be suspicious of the overzealous review but curious and want to experience the hotel for ourselves .we be disappointed.we request information from the covent garden hotel via e-mail three time and never receive a reply .two of the e-mail 's be address to the hotel and one be address to firmdale .eventually we have to contact the hotel via phone to have we question answer .once we hotel room be book the communication improve and we e-mail 's be return promptly.when we arrive at the covent garden hotel we find monmouth street under construction .the road be fill with sand , brick , machinery , gravel and construction equipment .a construction back hoe be park 10 foot from the hotel entrance and brasserie max restaurant .the construction begin several month ago and the estimate completion date be november 2005 .construction be very loud and begin very early in the morning and continue until late in the afternoon .we be very fortunate to have a room on the opposite side of the hotel and do not hear the construction while sleep .we talk to many sad and disappointed guest who be not so fortunate and be wake every morning by the sound of either jack hammer break concrete , machinery cut stone , or machinery tap the stone in place .monmouth street be very narrow and the noise be amplify along the street .we be very press for time in london and eat many meal at the brasserie max restaurant .during several meal we find the noise so loud we could not carry on a conversation .i feel very sorry for the hotel and its patron for this very unfortunate situation of which the hotel obviously have no control .catch any transportation at this hotel be a awkward experience at best .the construction outside the hotel involve reduce two way traffic to a single lane and add a brick sidewalk and designate parking space .the parking lane will have portion that jut out from the sidewalk in order to force a single lane .when they be finish it will be very difficult for vehicle to use monmouth as there will be no where for traffic to pass .if a car be park outside the hotel unload or wait for a passenger other car will be block and have to wait for the car to move .this will detract cab from pass by the hotel look for fare .on several occasion we see vehicle park outside wait for passenger and completely block the street .there be very few black cab that pass this hotel and the hotel doorman will either walk to the end of the street or jump in a car they keep a block away and search for a cab .many time there be no doorman in sight .do not be surprise if you arrive at the hotel and the doorman be block away try to catch a cab.we find the concierge service similar to concierge service we have experience at most london hotel .the theater ticket they purchase for we be very good but not fantastic .the concierge also help switch a reservation at popular restaurant to a different evening to accommodate we schedule but be unable to secure we preferred eating time.the hotel be well situate to many theater and you may not require a cab often .at night it be hard finding we way back to the covent garden hotel as the area be poorly light .many business near the covent garden hotel be either office or storefront and have they light turn off at night .with few landmark in the area we become lose on more than one occasion .at the end of monmouth there be a round about where seven street converge and all the street look similar especially at night .the hotel have place a huge british flag outside the hotel to provide some sense of direction to guests.we pay 255 pound plus vat for we superior room which include breakfast .have read a article write about the hotel that state the hotel policy be to automatically upgrade every single room to the next category when available .we get the impression that the hotel be not very busy and we be disappointed no upgrade be offer .we stay during peak season and the hotel do not appear very busy .reservation at the brassiere be never necessary and a good selection of table be always available breakfast , lunch and dinner .we superior room be well furnished and have a beautiful bathroom .the room seem very small to we even by london standard and perhaps have too much furniture in it .the room be so small it be difficult to unpack a suitcase .the cleaning staff do a excellent job and the room be spotlessly clean .the bathroom be well keep and look like new .the bar fridge be well stock but over price compare to similar uk hotel of similar category.the common hotel draw room be very nicely appoint .several day there be a sign on the elevator advise guest that the room be close for a private function during certain hour .consider this be the only drawing room in the entire hotel i think it be extremely pretentious of the hotel to close this room for a private function .the drawing room have a self serve bar with a attach kitchenette stock with chip , mixer and alcohol .the honesty bar be a novel idea but do not seem very popular with guest .do not expect self serve price as a self serve drink cost 8 pound for the alcohol and 2 pound for the mix.we eat several meal at the brasserie max and find the food to be hit and miss .we package include english breakfast .the breakfast be always overcook .the english breakfast be absolutely terrible each morning .on we second day i return the breakfast to the kitchen .the egg be stale , overcooked and cover in bacon grease .the bacon be extremely dry and the potato cake be completely black on one side .to say this be unacceptable for this type of hotel would be a understatement .the continental breakfast include many uncooked item and be far superior to the english breakfast .my wife like the fresh fruit which i thought be very nicely arranged.on we last day we have a early flight to catch to scotland and find the kitchen staff most rude and uncooperative .the hotel have offer a take away cappuccino and a bag breakfast but have forget about this .we arrive in the front lobby at 6:50 am and request entry 10 minute early to the brasserie max and the request be refuse .the restaurant and staff be ready for service but make we wait 10 minute until exactly 7:00 be .the staff than tell I that there be not enough time to cook a english breakfast with haste and meet my schedule .i would strongly disagree have previously have my breakfast burnt and discarded.after leave the covent garden hotel we go to edinburgh and stay in a deluxe suite at the balmoral hotel .it be interesting to compare the best hotel in scotland to the best hotel in london .we like the balmoral much better .the balmoral have better service , better food , better hotel amenity and better lobby .we enjoy we stay at the balmor far more than we do we stay at the covent garden hotel.our overall impression of the hotel be ordinary .do not agree with many of the review we read .would never stay at the covent garden hotel again ."

2,2,2,2,1,2,2,0,love it !!!my husband and i be at the riu taino from december 30th 2006 - january 6th 2007 .we have a amazing time !i have read about the garden be so lovely but i have not imagine how great they really be .we get to celebrate new year 's there and so they have close all the a la carte restaurant and serve lobster among other great thing in the main buffet area .there be a countdown party and so it be very exciting .overall i think the food be great .we have acce to 2 other riu hotel so there be always so many option as to where we could eat every meal .the breakfast be repetitive but honestly there be not all that much you can make for breakfast .everything we want be there .the a la carte restaurant be not as good as other place we have be to but they be not bad .i think it be a little funny that the salad/soup and dessert selection be still do buffet-style .we have room 1223 and it be very lovely .i like have those little villa instead of a huge hotel for everyone .it make it more intimate and romantic.the beach be very nice and the only downfall be that the weather be not the best .it rain on and off on many day and it be pretty windy most of the time .we still make the best out of it and have a blast .the hotel staff be always so friendly and welcome .they even let we keep we room for a extra 3 hour because i be pregnant .we go on the santo domingo tour and think it be worth every penny .it be a little long ..leave at 6am and arrive at 9 p.m but it really give we a idea of the dominican culture .overall excellent ... i do not see how anyone could complain ... we have be to several other place include europe and frankly this be a great hotel !the animation team be excellent .i have never see such great quality animation aside from cruise ship .beware : do not eat at the wendy 's at punta cana airport .my husband and i be sick exactly 2 hour after eat there and we be still deal with the consequence almost a week later !!!!!not fun !

2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,"good for we weekend getaway we enjoy the hotel .we be local and come in for the weekend with the kid to go to the theatre , museum , and just chill .as the other review indicate , the hotel could use some renovation but we room be good and we sleep well .it rain all weekend so be close to the pru mall and have the indoor pool be key to the weekend success , we book a non smoking room and the previous guest smoke in it - not good for we family so the bellman , deskstaff , and frequent-traveler husband deal with the siutation immediately and move we all quickly to a better room on the same floor.they also do not have bedrail for kid , so if you be travel with kid be sure to prepare for safe sleep - we 3yo fall out of bed during the night and hit he head on the nightstand .again , staff be excellent in bring lot of extra pillow to pad the floor .they be also quite concerned about my child and hopefully will stock up on bedrail !i be buy one for we next trip!good back bay location - close to symphony hall , duck tour , shopping , newbury street , hospital , t station right at pru ,"
2,0,0,0,2,2,2,1,"very nice but need update we stay at uma for 3 night last week .we have pay for a terrace room but be upgrade to a garden room .overall the hotel be very nice however for the price we pay the value be not there .the room be a good size , especially since we be travel with we young daughter , but the room be tire and be in need of update .there be nothing on the wall other than white drywall so you really notice that the tiling be in need of repair , stain on the wall , the mosquito net have tear and the towel be often tattered .it look like the hotel be once absolutely wonderful but it have now past its glory day .it need some love and care ... or at a minimum something on the wall so you do not notice all the fault .if you stay in a garden room i recommend ask for # 16 as it have the biggest garden area .i do not see the villa so perhaps they be in better shape and have be more recently update .i would stay at uma again but not at the price we pay .i think a fair price for what you get would be around the we $ 100 mark .we pay almost the same price that we pay at the ritz carlton the week before .although lovely and charming , uma be nowhere near the same category.the food at uma be fabulous .breakfast be excellent as be dinner .i would also recommend go to glow at como shambalah -lrb- uma 's sister property -rrb- for one of the best dinner you will ever have .also indus restaurant be walk distance down the road which be one of the best restaurant we experience while there .naughty nuri 's -lrb- where all the local ` expat ' hang ... and drink waaaay too much -rrb- be also across the street and they serve easily what can be consider the best martini in all of balus if not indonesia .some people rave about the food there , but i be mainly impress by they martinis.the spa be excellent and the price be much more reasonable .definitely worth a visit .service be nice and friendly and everyone cheerfully help when you ask .really good service predict you need and next move so that you do not have to always ask .uma 's not quite at that level yet .or my expectation may have be influence by the ritz the week before where the service be outstanding .like i say , the price we pay be very similar so i guess i expect the same level of service.in my opinion the hotel be not walk distance to the town .we do walk it once but it be not something you will want to do frequently unless you be a avid walker , especially come back to the hotel where it be uphill the whole way .also the shuttle leave only once every 2 hour , so we be unable to rely on it as a mode of transport unless we want to base all we plan around when the shuttle leave and come back .taxi be a better way to go .the hotel taxi be about 2-3 time the price than if you walk out onto the road and hail one yourself .depend on how comfortable you be do that and how comfortable you be bargaining .overall i like uma and i would stay again , but i would not stay there for the price they have we pay ... unless of course they update the room and take they service to the next level .base on some of the other guest we meet while we be there , i suspect that there be a large discrepancy in the price different people be quote and be pay .we be the unlucky one i guess ."

2,1,2,-1,2,-1,2,-1,would i drop $ 500 ?no .maybe $ 300.00 my wife and i enjoy 6 nite at the ritz in san juan .we stay on company business .i would say its a excellent choice for the gambler who want 3 nite in jan or feb at about $ 300 per nite .it would not be worth $ 500 per nite on my income level .the hotel and service be excellent but the location and the beach be weak .the hotel be located next to the airport so you will wake up to that 7:30 be jet take off .the transfer back and forth to the hotel be cheap but the nightly trip to old san juan be $ 20.00 one way .no way you can play golf without rent a car .the golf course be located at least 45 min to a hour away .we eat at the hotel restaurant one nite .the 787 prime serve the best chateaubriand that i ever have .everyone else enjoy they food tremendously .the hotel have 2 tennis court right next to the pool .there be a large casino located next to the lobby .the casino house a nice large screen so i could enjoy my heel whip duke .they seem to have a band playing in the hotel lobby bar every night .the pool be large yet look old .they need to power wash the tile in the pool and exterior facade of hotel .the service by the pool and on the beach be excellent .the towel hut offer complimentary orange and apple every day .one exceptionally nice amenity for the hotel be the free use of the hobie cat/catamran sailboat .the banana boat be only $ 15 too .
0,0,0,-1,1,-1,0,-1,"not worth the price i have book for 2 room and when i arrive , the room be on different floor .i expect for interconnect room or at least 2 room not too far one from the other .i ask for a change and they can find I 2 room separate by 2 other room .this hotel be very close to lax airport and have a shuttle to the airport every 10 mn .the room be clean but not well maintain .in the bathroom , you can not close the drain of the sink .in the tub , you can not have full water for the shower .half be lose in the tub .some lamp be not work because they be unplugged .and this hotel charge double than the other other in the lax airport area .not worth it ."

2,2,1,0,1,2,2,1,"unbelievable service i have never receive service like i receive at the elegante during my four night stay .the staff bent over backwards to ensure that i have everything that i need .we be in the lobby on we way to dinner and be try to figure out how to get to the restaurant .a employee see we struggle with direction and take we to the computer where he print out the route .he advise we of construction and give a way to avoid it .i notice that he be not dress like the rest of the staff and ask what he do at the hotel ... he be one of the maintenance worker .i stay at the omnus two week before and could not get anyone at the front desk to help.the mcm be a average hotel , clean , quiet with nice room .the area be a bit concern , but i would definitely stay at the hotel again , for the staff alone ."
1,2,0,2,1,2,1,0,"good value hotel just back from 3 night at the pelangus .get a good deal on a superior double with breakfast .meet at the airport by friendly driver , smooth easy check in , welcome drink , cold refreshing towel , friendly smiley service in general.rooms be ok , good size , comfortable bed , everything worked.bathroom could have be a little nicer .eventho be clean ..a little mould here and there , give it a very slight grotty feeling .but hey , for the price and for the amount of time that you actually be go to be in you hotel room in balus , it be fine .i think it could be a really great hotel if they spend a little more time and effort upkeep it .the grounds and garden be generally nice enough.breakfast be disappointing , presentation and variety be sadly lack .staff a little lackadaisical tho polite .nice view of the surf tho .pool look almost as good as in the photo on the website .have a lovely evening swim under the star which be great.if you want a 5 star luxurious stay , this aint it .there be heap of villa for rent that will do the trick but the pelangi be good value for money , comfortable and be pretty well situate .get a flight into balus be difficult , with most of they sell out .we flight be pack ... but once out and about in seminyak - it feel a little dead ... heap of great restaurant , shop and bar but all empty ."

1,1,1,2,0,2,1,1,decent package deal hotel room be decent for the price pay for .it do show some age in the wall and furniture but serve the purpose for a place to stay .small kichenette be useful for the fridge and microwave .should always prefer a double over a single king size bed since the room be so much more !conveniently across from the international market and walk distance to the beach .also have complimentary trolley to the mall .

0,0,0,2,0,0,0,-1,"avoid if possible there be only 2 thing go for this hotel -- its location and its breakfast buffet .we should have hear warn bell from the outset when we be make we reservation -- the person be audibly typing on he computer the entire time and be not pay attention to anything i be ask .i have to keep repeat myself and the only time he truly snap to attention be when i confirm my reservation .when we check in , the room on the higher floor that i would request -lrb- note -- it be the higher floor that have be renovate -rrb- be not ready .we be give one on a low floor .i decide to give it a chance but it be not long before we find 1 -rrb- the previous occupant ' crusty oily stain on the sheet and hair in the sink , and 2 -rrb- that the bathtub be not work -lrb- the stopper be screw so there could be no chance of soak in the tub -rrb- .a technician come to try to fix the tub , but he could not .he have the sense to say he would ask for another room for us.we eventually get another room -- on the supposedly renovate higher floor -- but on enter with the porter , we be all appal to find the toilet repeatedly flush and overflow .the bathroom floor be flood .i be not prepare to repack all my stuff again , so we sit down and wait for a technician to fix that and housekeeping to come clean up the bathroom .the technician take age to come -lrb- while gallon of water continue pour out -rrb- , and housekeeping take even longer .we be die to pee !and in the meantime , we find some creamy white stuff on the sheet ... honestly , like i would say , the only thing go for this hotel be the location -- be very central and connected to a nice mall -- and its breakfast buffet -- yummy , substantial and in a very pleasant environment .if you get one of those unrenovated room , be prepare for thing not work and icky stuff on the old furnishings .housekeeping be horribly inefficient -- you could be go for 3 hour or even 6 , and you room can still not be make up .and the scum on the bathtub be proof of how well they do they job.the bathroom , incidentally , be not child-friendly -- there be only a fix shower overhead , which mean you will have difficulty wash you little one down ."
0,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,"pass if you can ok , i know it be go to be expensive .i be think it would be ok for one night .i have a early flight and i like the convenience of the airport .unfortunately there be too many other bad thing to say about the service , the price and the value .on the upside , the room and the bath be both very large with nice soap and body wash , et cetera .there be a great tv and movie in several language plus internet and of course great airport access .so i be initially please with the amenity .unfortunately , the room have a very bad -lrb- stale -rrb- smell and the window would not open .by the way no one else among the staff could smell what i be smell and they could only offer another room for a even higher price .the concierge be not able to recommend a single cafe or shopping area that would be open on a sunday afternoon in frankfurt .the dining room be elegant , but the food be only ok .the salad bar be stale and the service be extremely slow .the staff seem to be more interested in talk among themselves than serve guest .overall , the meal be way over price .so i return to my smelly room .room service be ok and my night time snack be good .the wall be so thin i could hear every person that walk near my room .after a bad night 's sleep on a king bed , i checked-out and go to the airport where i find over price food of equal quality for half the cost of the sheraton .even if you do have lot of money to throw away and even if it be just for one night , my advice be to take a extra few minute and find another choice .i think we can expect more from a sheraton and at these price i feel certain you will get a lot more elsewhere ."

0,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,terrible experience i stay at the sheraton princess kaiulanus from 2/7 -2 / 12/08 to attend a family member 's wedding and i be very disappointed with the overall experience .we basically receive a room that be not as describe in the original reservation and the only accommodation the hotel have available be for a upgrade which we have to pay for .the only explanation the front desk could give we be that all basic room be describe as a cityview room with balcony etc. and that a cityside room which be much smaller with no balcony can also be describe as such .i feel this be very deceptive and we would not have stay there if give that option .we actually have reservation at another hotel but cancel because we think we be get a certain level of accommodation .in addition we have no problem correspond with the group reservation agent keri shiramizu prior to we arrival but after we arrive she do not respond to a voicemail or email regard the room situation .overall we have a terrible experience with this hotel and will never stay here again .

it give you the ability to get a median idea - toss out the 鈥渢his be the greatest place on earth鈥?and the 鈥渢his be the worst hotel ever鈥?comments and you arrive somewhere near the truth of the matter .let I first say i have yet to complain about any one of my hotel stay in either europe , america or mexico .i鈥檓 in my early 30鈥檚 have stay in paris , rome , munich , dublin , d.c. , west palm , texa , miami , cape cod , l.a. , san fran , turk caico , puerto rico , st. kitt , grand bahama paradise island , and various locale in mexico .that be say i would like to warn other about this hotel .i list those locale to merely say that my stay at mbr for the price - be well not worth it .there be no way this hotel deserve a 4 star rating .i have never have a problem with any hotel i have every stay at that be bill as a 3 star hotel or higher .i鈥檝e stay in 2 star hotel / motel that have better service than the miami beach resort spa .when the word resort be place in the name of a hotel you expect high quality .i bring my in-law who fly in from dublin to this hotel in the expectation that with a billing of 鈥渞esort , 鈥?a title which they be accustom to for beach resort locale in europe , it would be full of amenity .if i have choose simply a hotel i would have expect just room and perhaps a hotel bar .the most impressive feature about this hotel be the lobby .exquisite marble and chandelier - very neat and orderly reservation desk .however , one do not sleep in the lobby .the parking attendant , though harry , be very good about get the car -lrb- except one day which take over 25 minute to get my rental from the garage -rrb- .i book my trip package through expedia for 2 room with a king-size bed .the check in be very smooth , we arrive earlier than the permissible 3pm and they be very amenable to get we check in early .the bellman be very pleasant .however we room be place on separate floor , which in and of itself be not a problem and the lady at the desk do alert we to this fact .funnily enough the desk clerk offer we a mini-bar key which we decline but when we get to the room there be no mini-bar .my husband鈥檚 parent stay on the 10th floor with a partial view of the ocean and bay .we be put on the 4th floor in a newly renovate room which happen to be eye level with the extend roof - so if you picture a ceiling to floor window the tiled floor of we hotel room -lrb- no rug -rrb- be on level with the rooftop of the 3rd floor mezzanine - give we a unsightly grayish black roof .beyond the roof view be a partial view of the ocean and directly across from we room be a high-rise condo complex who have a direct view of we room unless we fully drag the floor to ceiling drape close - which of course then darken the already unwell light room .this room have be renovate to be uber-modern - sky blue wall and ceiling which be fine - a open floor plan so the bed be in the middle of the room a float oak-ish look closet so you could see past the bed into the bathroom area - no privacy at all .not a lot of hang space .plenty of drawer but shallow so you can鈥檛 fit much .the shower be great - very modern - huge showerhead - the size of a soccer ball - with a floor to ceiling frosted door .the toilet also have a floor to ceiling frosted door - which be very un-conducive to privacy and tiny to get in and out of because of the way the door swing .the rectangular basin sink be interesting -lrb- but didn鈥檛 drain well -rrb- and the mirror be large but they both perpendicularly abut the shower which make difficult for 2 people get ready at same time .the florescent lighting be so low you could barely see to put on make-up .there be no floor to ceiling mirror to check yourself out before you leave the room .i鈥檓 all for modern but it also have to be functional .the maid come everyday to clean the room , but perhaps since we entire room be tile , and i personally prefer rug b/c i don鈥檛 like walk on tile barefoot , i find that the area near the shower be not clean thoroughly .i have very long hair and would find daily hair that be not pick up by either a mop or vacuum .have say all that - the room be not a major problem with we .the in-law鈥檚 room , in contrast , be lovely .more traditional - clean - large - nice view .so if you鈥檙e look for a basic room w/o frill it鈥檚 not bad.in term of service - i find , again , for a resort , it to be severely lack in both it鈥檚 offering and customer service .the only caveat be the front desk clerk which be all pleasant .the concierge however be a different experience all together .my husband鈥檚 birthday be on july 2nd and we be also down in miami for the july 4th holiday .the first night we be there i ask if there be any restaurant nearby because we be tire we didn鈥檛 feel like go to south beach which be about a 7-10 minute ride depend on traffic .he coldly tell we well there weren鈥檛 that many option .now , at a resort , one would think you鈥檇 have someone who鈥檚 entire job be define by he ability to offer service to customer .he make we feel like we be bother he .i鈥檝e live in nyc my entire life .i鈥檓 use to the haughtiness of some of the finer hotels/restaurants/bars .this place be certainly not worthy of such a attitude as one would expect at say the ritz .i go to the concierge to ask if there be any good cuban restaurants鈥 be response鈥 $ 漵ure.鈥?that鈥檚 it .i go to the concierge twice more to ask for advice on restaurant , thing to do etc. ... when i ask if there be event go on for july 4th - he respond - of course w/o further explanation .it be like be a homicide detective try to pry answer from the murderer .they have no guide to look at for restaurant or activity like most other resort i have be to.if you want to fork over a exorbitant amount of money for sub-par food than stay here .i鈥檝e stay at the hyatt resort - a 5 star hotel in aruba - and there food be less expensive and 5 time better .the breakfast food for 2 people plus a 17 % gratuity -lrb- which be automatically attribute to every single bill at the hotel whether you鈥檙e just order fries or a cocktail -rrb- cost we 39 dollar .again , i live in nyc and 2 egg over-easy with ham with one glass of oj do not equal 39 dollar , it equal extortion .we have dinner at they restaurant which do have beautiful view overlook the pool and miami beach .each entr茅e be 25 dollar or more and it be horrid - and i鈥檓 not a finicky eater .i have mahi-mahus , as do my husband , which turn out look and tasting like a overdo fish sandwich from a fast-food place .i order tuna sashimi as a appetizer - it鈥檚 hard to screw up raw fish - but they manage to do so .i didn鈥檛 even eat my meal .my husband - not a finicky either - eat it only because it be late and he be starve and we have no other course of action .he parent have steak - which be overcooked - and pasta which be like mush .the bill for 4 people be just shy of $ 300 and the food be awful .i wouldn鈥檛 have pay 10 dollar for the food that be serve , so dish out 25 dollar per dish be offensive .do not eat at they restaurant .the pool bar be handy if you ready yourself for just finger food or bbq type of food - but again overprice .one day the four of we have 4 caesar salad , and 2 drink each and it come to $ 125 - this place just literally leave a bad taste in my mouth .you be hold ransom here with such exorbitant price b/c this hotel be located far off the main strip - 10 minute north of south beach or any place to eat on collin avenue .my husband and i walk around one day in search of a deli b/c all we want be a iced tea and a sandwich - needless to say we walk down collin and didn鈥檛 reach a deli until we hit south beach .pool be fine - relatively long - not wide - but clean .plenty of lounge and very comfortable cushion .pool side restaurant be decent .maybe 8 thing on menu though so after 2 day you get sick of order a chicken sandwich with greasy fries , or a small burger or a 9 dollar salad .the wing be awful .it have fan hang from rafter which constantly vacillate and mist water .i suppose this be suppose to keep you cool , but i find it annoying - you constantly feel damp while sit there eat .drink be somewhat expensive -lrb- again i鈥檓 use to high price in nyc -rrb- but it be $ 6 for domestic bottle of beer , $ 8 for mixed drink and more if you want something off they standard cocktail menu - plus for every drink you order they bang you automatically 17 % gratuity .i bartended in nyc and i find the gratuity ridiculous .staff be friendly enough - if you could wave they down and if per chance they speak english .i live in a melting pot city so i鈥檓 use to it but my irish in-law have trouble understand what the staff be say because everyone work as the wait staff , snack bar , or bartender speak broken english.their snack shop charge $ 2.18 for a regular size cup of hot tea and close to 3 buck for a stale bagel with nothing on it .in nyc you can get a bagel for 60 cent .if you want tea for room service it be $ 5 or $ 8 for a large cup of tea鈥 ?.for hot water and a lipton bag .they wine be cheaper than hot water for $ 7 .no vend machine in case you simply want a water or a soda.location really not great .i鈥檝e stay in bal harbor -lrb- about 10 min .north of this area -rrb- before and at least you could walk to restaurant or shop .here you can get to a boardwalk via the beach 2 block down .the boardwalk be lovely and you can get a birds-eye view of other hotel .a long hike to get to any other restaurant .but beware there鈥檚 no escape the sun .the beach be clean and there be a hut for wave - runner and other activity if you so desire .but if you want to lay out on the beach -lrb- which be a public beach -rrb- you have to pay for chair and umbrella .i think it be $ 5 for a chair and $ 15 for a umbrella - ridiculous .when you think you be go to a resort - you justly assume this be part of the resort fee - which they charge 10 dollar per room per day - plus tax per day of $ 1.30 - so for 5 day it be $ 56.50 each room .i鈥檓 sorry but i鈥檓 confuse as to what this fee be for鈥 s another reviewer say - for towel - which be threadbare?bottom line-wouldn鈥檛 recommend to anyone - would never stay here again - it be way overprice for what be offered-and i live in nyc for decade , i.e. i鈥檓 use to high price .as one reviewer say , 鈥淭he only thing remotely pleasant about this hotel be that we do not spend much time there.鈥?i second that notion .most time we spend there be by the pool ."

staff obviously clean up frequently , but there be a storm off-shore that make the water a little choppy and hence dislodge more seaweed than typical , especially in the last few day of we trip .wave be safe for yound child ... i want more and bigger , but this be the wrong location be you be look for surfing .royal service have a private beach area with a bar -lrb- for those say that you need a bar on the beach -rrb- .non royal service beach do not have a bar.poolsgreat pool , lot of variety .if you go during the slow season certainly stop by the tropical side .pool to yourselve .we find out about this on we first day as we be investigate the kid ' club right next to tropical pool.kids ' clubour baby be treat like royalty .at this time of year , she be the only baby around , so she have personal service .definitely seek out dania and raquel - they be awesome .kid ' club for we 5 year-old be a disappointment .it be probably really good when the resort be full , but this be the downpart of low season - no kid for she to play with .she opt not to go to the kid ' club and spend she time with we instead.languagenot one to mince word , i have to tell you that this be a spanish country .if you ethnocentrism be go to cause you to have a bad time because the local can not understand you to you satisfaction , then i suggest that you would be better off either stay home , or choose a island that be english-speaking .please do not be a ugly tourist .go and enjoy the people , they will try hard to work with you if you try hard to work with they .learn a few simple spanish phrase can go a long way.peopleall of the staff be fantastic .be careful not to take they to they word when it come to time -

1,0,0,2,0,2,2,0,"good resort , tired room .we just return from a one week stay at the riu naiboa .we stay with my extend family as a party of 6 with 3 room .my main advice for anyone consider the riu naiboa be just know what you be get .some travel site and riu itself list this as a 4 star resort .it be not .the naiboa be a older property that be get a bit threadbare .not that you should not consider it , but know what you be get .i will give the bottom line now : this resort be a good value for the price , but the room be in need of update so expect some problem .the food be good , the pool and beach be great.the shine star of the stay be the resort staff !from the front desk to the bar and wait staff , everyone be friendly , smile , and willing to do what it take to make the vacation a great one .now the detail : room - when we check in , we first room have a bathroom ceiling that be nearly cave in , a crack tub , a patio door with no lock whatsoever , and even though we request -lrb- and the front desk staff state we have -rrb- a non smoking room , it reek of smoke .we politely ask if we could change room , but the resort be full that night , so the very helpful manager assure we we would have a new room the next day and true to he word , we did.sadly , this room be better , but not much better .at least it do not reek of smoke -lrb- a major issue for I , i have allergy -rrb- , but it have a thermostat that be literally miss , with nothing but expose wire where it should have be .honest , i have a picture of it .the ceiling fan and the bathroom light be on all the time regardless of the position of the light switch , and the linen be terribly worn .in addition , all of we party and 5 or 6 other party we talk to have the same issue with they room : - little or no air conditioning .- the bed and pillow be rock hard .- each room seem to have 5 or 6 maintenance issue .tv not work , cracks/holes in wall , miss lamp shades with bare bulb , miss tile , leak plumbing , etc , etcbottom line be the room be tired and need update .nuff said.but this be a beach resort , so how be it outside the room ?great!pool / beach - the naiboa have the best pool and best bar of the whole riu complex !and people actually stay at the better riu resort , but use the pool and bar at the naiboa every day .we meet 4 party that admit to this because the pool be larger and the outdoor terrace/bar be fan-freaking-tastic .the beach be great , but stake out you spot early every morning .it get crowd .if you be interested in snorkeling , there be a reef just outside of the swim area .email I if you want detail .food/drink - the food be good , i would say it be on par with what i expect .one major issue : the resort advertise a italian restaurant in addition to the buffet restaurant .what they do not tell you be that this italian restaurant be share with another riu resort .you must make reservation to eat at the italian place and they start take reservation every morning at 7 am !each resort get 12 of the 24 table , so the place be book solid by 7:20 every day .start to take reservation at 7:00 be be just plain stupid and i have criticize other riu resort we have stay at for adhering to this ridiculous practice .who want to drag themselves out of bed at 7:00 be while they be on vacation ?bottom line be the vast majority of guest will only eat at the buffet .but that be not the end of the world .the buffet be good .i have have better , but i have certainly have much worse and , again , at much more expensive resort than this .atmosphere/people - i really enjoy the different nationality and american be definitely in the minority here .not that that be a bad thing , if i want to hang out with american i would stay home .do not be afraid to engage you fellow traveler in conversation .a couple of thing to be aware of .parent should understand that some european woman will be topless at the beach and pool .also , the resort staff will serve alcohol to anyone who look to be roughly 18 give or take a few year if you know what i mean .just so you know and plan accordingly.the resort seem to be popular with canadian bachelor party group .two group in particular become very drunk and repeatedly engage in lewd behavior with female member of they group .other people complain to the staff , and again to the staff 's credit , they put a stop to it .if you see inappropriate behavior , complain and the staff will take care of it.overall , i would rate the naiboa a 6 out of 10 .i would say it be a good value for family and those on a budget .just do not expect 4 star quality and flawless room ."

mediterranean-themed carpet and wall color , decent-size tv , etc. .. -rrb-, but the view from the terrace can be marginal -lrb- unless you like look down on alleyway , tin roof , and into other people 's apartment nearby -rrb- , and the air conditioning do not seem to work.oh , and the hotel do not have any fan .fortunately , there be a supermarket a half-block up las ramblas -lrb- on the same side of the street -rrb- , own by the carrefour consortium -lrb- which mean it be much like most any other major supermarket chain you might encounter in europe -rrb- .on the first floor , they have get fresh vegetable , drink , personal grooming product , electrical equipment -lrb- include fan -rrb- , etc. ... make sure to check you bag in at the front desk before you enter the store , and keep in mind that if you be go to use a shopping cart that the only way downstairs -lrb- to all the package food , dairy product , fresh meat and cheese , etc. .. -rrb-will be the elevator on the right , and be not well marked unless you be look up at the sign above you head .otherwise , you will want to stick with a hand-basket and the escalator or stairs.the bed in this room be amazingly hard -- the hardest bed i think i have ever try to sleep on .i be not sure , but i may have have a softer bed at time in the past when i be camping , with my sleep bag on the ground .or when i be crash with friend , lay directly on a hard concrete floor with a thin layer of carpet .but my wife be absolutely in love with the pillow -- they give each of you a huge two foot by two foot back pillow , and a smaller pillow to use while sleep , and they be high quality down/feather .but why have a nice bathroom with lot of marble and mirror , if you be go to get a sewer stink ?we pass a sewer on las ramblas , so we know for sure what that smell be , we just can not be 100 % certain where it be come from in the bathroom .and why have just one bar of soap in the bathroom ?do not you want a large one in or near the bath/shower , and a smaller one near the sink ?after you have wash yourself in the shower with the large bath bar , do you want to use that same bar again to wash you hand or face in or over the sink?note that the shower be very powerful -lrb- enough to hurt , if you turn it on full strength -rrb- , and can get very , very hot -- think mcdonald 's coffee hot .i like hot shower , and i like long shower .i could only turn the handle very slightly past the halfway point before i feel like i be be scald .and the hot water never run out .the tub be also very deep , but be make out of plastic and be rather disconcert to feel it move underneath my foot .i later decide that it be intentional to have the floor of the tub have a slight give to it , to make it feel a bit softer and more comfortable .it also have raise spot spread throughout , which i presume be intend to have some sort of massage effect on you foot .the electrical power in the room be also marginal -- we lose all power earlier today , but we be not sure if it be a breaker that flip or a result of the construction .we be leave at the time , so it do not really matter .but i would be very concerned if that kind of thing happen when we be go to be in the room for a while .tonight , we have notice that all the other light in the room will flicker when you turn on another electrical device.also note that most of the light in the room be compact fluorescent , which tend to give off a kind of greenish glow , and do not put out a lot of light .if you have seasonal affective disorder

.unfortunately , the floor-standing lamp be fairly weak -lrb- i be guess 100 watt or 150 watt , instead of the standard 300 watt -rrb- .it take we a while to figure out how to turn on the floor-standing lamp , and even have the engineer come up to take a look at it to see what need to be fixed.avoid room 627 at all possible cost .it be long and thin -lrb- and weirdly shape -rrb- , with a tiny breakfast/living area at one end , and a tiny bedroom area at the other -lrb- just barely large enough to contain the bed -rrb- .the air conditioning do work well , but it drip -- make sure you do not put anything underneath the vent on the ceiling in the hallway area.this room may have two tv -lrb- one in the living area and one in the bedroom area -rrb- , but the one in the bedroom area can not display any of the on-demand movie or other special content .you can get the small selection of satellite tv channel , and that be it.the one save grace of room 627 be that it have a much larger and nicer terrace than any of the other mediterranean suite , with view of three side of the hotel .the other suite on the sixth floor look out mostly onto other nearby buildings.as far as the food be concern , the room service menu be very minimal .the soup have be good , the single-serving size margarita -lrb- only cheese , no sauce or other topping -rrb- pizza be hand-tossed thin-crust style -lrb- which my wife like but i do not -rrb- , the club sandwich be very good , the chicken with green tagliatelle pasta be okay.but whatever you do , do * not * eat dinner in the restaurant downstairs .it look nice enough , the dinner be buffet-style -lrb- which my wife and i think we would appreciate -rrb- , but the food itself be marginal at best .it take I a long time to figure out when i last have cafeteria style food that be worse -- i have to go back to school lunch that i have in sixth grade , and even some of they be better .and the restaurant downstairs be euro-style expensive , with dinner for one person run something like 30 euros.the bar look nice , and they be suppose to have live entertainment tuesday through saturday .we have not actually do anything there , but i think it would be hard to screw that up too badly.if you room be on the fifth floor or below , you have two elevator to choose from .if you be on the sixth floor or above , there be only one

2,0,2,-1,0,-1,2,-1,"6/1/06 - 6/7/06 have a great time ... probably would not go back .ok ... first of all ... i think it be important to know where a person be come from when they be give a review .with that in mind ... the follow help to define that ... about uswe be a couple in we 30 's .we have one child and value romantic getaway that be adult only ... we have travel a lot and have stay in the following country -lrb- mexico , tahiti , bora bora , spain , canada , barbado , martinique , st. maarten , bahama -rrb- .we consider ourselves work middle class and though we live within we means and budget wisely , we save to travel and love it!why we choose this resortwe have consider go back to the riviera maya but with last year 's hurricane , we decide when we plan this trip , to try a different all-inclusive and read some great thing about punta cana .we choose secret because of the adult only , beautiful beach , and variety of restaurant within the resort .we overall feeling about we trip ... we have a great time , think the location be beautiful , but would not stay there again.the resort ... it be lay out very nicely .spread out , but not so much that you have to walk a ton to get to anything .the lobby be very nice .lot of water feature everywhere .lot of nature and beauty .in front of the hotel be large grounds with trail , bridge , garden , and water feature .we have a nice time walk around it and take pictures.our room ... we originally book a regular room but when we arrive we take a look at it and be offer to upgrade to a excellence suite with ocean view .we look at we regular room then look at the excellence room and agree to pay the extra $ 100 a night for the upgrade .there be no way we could turn it down consider the original room have a view of some construction and a run down garden area .the excellence room be great .we have a corner room with balcony that wrap around 2 side .we be right over the pool with a unobstructed gorgeous view of the ocean .-lrb- they really know how to make it irresistable to turn down -rrb- .the room be larger than the first and be much brighter and cheerier .the tub that separate the bedroom from the vanity area be in all room and be very nice .we have bathrobe , slipper , bottle of champagne and fruit tray .that first night at turn down service ... the maid fill the tub with bubble and bougainvilia petal and have candle light all around the tub .the minus fridge be a waste .it be never cold enough to make anything refreshing enough to drink without we chill thing first in a ice bucket .the bed of doom ... ok this part really put a damper on we vacation .we like firm bed .we both have bad back and appreciate a bed that you do not sink into cause you back to be out of line ... but this bed be torturous .it be like sleep on the marble floor .it be a rock hard firm mattress on slat of wood .we wake up the first morning so stiff ... we call and talk to someone about the bed but be tell there be nothing they could do about it .we decide to try and sleep outside on one of the pool bed .problem be ... they cover all those every night with all the pool floaty and lounge cushion .we start get up really early at 6am and go out after they take everything off the palapa bed and get some rest there for a few hour every morning .if the bed have be normal ... we room would have be truly excellent.the pool ... we enjoy the pool .it be long , however not as long and large as some other resort we have be to -lrb- palace resort -rrb- .the water temp be warm ... not refresh enough from the aweful heat .it do have some nice nook and cranny for privacy and some shaded area as well .we really enjoy the pool palapa bed .that be great to be able to lie there all day in the shade and enjoy read a book and stretch out .people do however hog the floaty and i must say ... to all of you who think it be acceptable to stow away a hotel floatie under you loiunge chair all day with you use of it consist of a total of 15 minute the whole day ... shame on you for you selfishness.when we find one and use it ... we leave it in the pool for someone else to use when we be do .if everyone do that ... there would never be a shortage for anyone.the beach ... this be the best part of this resort !we love love love the beach here .apart from the south pacific island ... this be the only place i have be where you could walk on the beach and be the only one .it be a huge beach with a very wide sand bank between the resort and the ocean .it can seriously burn you foot if you try to get to the ocean without flip flop on .the red flag be out every day -lrb- do they ever change it ? -rrb-but the tide be never strong .at all .not in the least .it be awesome !we boogie board just about every day .the stinky thing be ... they will only let you check the board out for a hour at a time even though they always have a surplus available .we have a great time do it though ... just be a long walk back to the boogie board hut .one thing we be very disappointed in that i would recommend to those who have not be tell ... we have no idea that around to the right side of the beach , if you walk a while ... you will come to a shore with reef a plenty for great snorkeling .the hotel have flipper and mask you can check out and we see they ... but we do not know you could actually get to some reef if you go beyond the resort .i wish we have know .: -lrb- the bars/drinksthis part of the resort be so-so .it really depend on which bar you go to and who be mix .but we find consistent drink mixed well at the main lobby bar by the bordeoux restaurant at night .there be no refrigeration of drink except the water bottle and presidente beer bottle .soda be not refrigerate , thus water down upon mix with ice .we fare ok .i do love the dirty monkey no matter where i get them.the restaurantswe try all except the dominican .same reason as why most do not .not that much into cabrito -lrb- goat meat -rrb- , though it be dominican 's most popular dish and probably good.that restaurant along with the mexican el patio share a building .we enjoy the mexican resaurant and the service there .they have a 3 man mariachus group who sing and play for $ and the lighting/ambiance be lovely there.one room house 3 restaurant .the main buffet which serve daily breakfast and lunch , turn into italian on one side and japanese on the other side at night .we love the japanese -lrb- himitsu -rrb- .think the food be very good .great spring roll and sushi.the italian be ... below average .the 2 ocean front reastaurant be open air palapa and we do not enjoy either one much .the beef be below par quality .i be shock that there be not more seafood option such as crab leg or lobster consider we be on the ocean and i actually see a large crab on the beach one day .we never see lobster be offer and though the french restaurant serve lobster bisque , it be more of a seafood consume make from the remnant of the day ' other seafood fare.we enjoy the french restaurant and they server and they have the best desserts.for the most part i would say the resort be lack in the food department .it would be great if they have a actual sea side grill .a actual grill ... where you could walk up and get grilled seafood , sausage , hamburger ... etc. as we have see at other ocean/pool side all inclusive .*** important **** we reserve a romatic dinner at the open air oceana restaurant one evening .we be seat on the patio with a view of the ocean .there be 4 other couple do the same thing that evening .we be seat at 6:30 pm and within 15 minute bite midge be attack I .now , ofcourse i do not know what they be at the time .i think mosquito be get we .needless to say ... all 5 of we couple have to gulp down what little food they have bring by that point and leave asap !that be a week ago and i be still suffer with these demonic bug bite .i become very concerned yesterday as new bump seem to keep pop up and they itch like poison hell fire or something .in spanish they be call gegene -lrb- heh-heh-ne -rrb- but in english we know they as no see um or sand fly .they be basically midget mosquito gnat and can actually infect you with a microfilareia -lrb- small larva worm -rrb- .my only remedy be to apply pruitic cream and take antihistamine for relief .again , they real name be bite midge.now mind you ... we have take bug repellant and have be to the night time beach party , horseback ride , lay around the pool , etc and have never be bite by anything so do not feel like i need to apply chemical .this situation happen on the night before we leave , on the patio of the pool side restaurant .if i have be wear repellant i be sure they would not have get I .my husband have just a few bite .i however , have both leg , arm , neck , and ear cover in these aweful pustule .again , it be be 6 day since that night .ughhh !!!!i have since learn they fly in swarm and stay very close to they nest .they probably have a nest in the bush by the patio .the spawe have a couple massage at midnight on the beach one night .it be lovely , in candlelight .very relaxing.excursionswe do the free horseback ride one morning .it be fun .my horse keep try to bite my husband 's .it be a lot of laugh .i be extremely sore the next day ... which just remind I of the laugh .: -rrb- one day we do the carribean festival which be take a horrible hour and 20 minute ride on a open air jalopy to bavaro beach and get on a very fun double deck boat which take we to a lack snorkeling site ... then to a fence in tank in the ocean where they hold 2 nurse shark and 2 manta ray .i get to swim with and run my hand along a 15 foot long nurse shark .that be exhilirate .i do however feel very sad for the creature stick in this fence in tank which probably measure 35 ft x 35 ft. there be 3 such tanks.the party boat though be a great time and make that way by the staff/dancers .they put on a mini carnival and really make the crowd participate and have fun .they be excellent dancer and entertainer .we have to make the hour and 20 minute ride back to secret ... it sucked.the staffus find that the majority of the staff be not from the dominican republic .those that be , be from far away on the island .they live in a commune across the street from the resort .they work very long hour ... some work 11 day in a row then have 3 day off .the same people serve breakfast and work in the morning be there at 8pm still serve dinner and working .every one be train to look you in the eye no matter where or when they encounter you and greet you .i appreciate this much and it remind I how sad american culture be consider most people look away or act like they do not see you when you be walk past they .the staff be train ... when you ask they how they be ... to say excellent .they be also train to respond it be my pleasure no matter what you say or ask of they .we tip a lot ... and i begin to feel as if a lot of they be embarrassed or uncomfortable with this .before we leave ... i go and find this one hostess who really go out of she way and be great ... to give she a $ 20 bill before we leave .i tell she we really appreciate she service and hard work and she seem embarrassed to accept the money and state it be my job.i have a feeling ... that with all the tip go on ... we leave the impression that money be disposable .i tip because i feel like i do not know how much these people be get pay and what if they be get jipp or be take advantage of ... therefore i want to help let they know they be worth more than they think .how presumptuous of I .we as american can be so pompously naive sometimes.ok enough of the social commentary ... overall ... we have a great time .we would not go back there because we like to experience different area , culture and resort .we only revisit somewhere if it be exceptional which we do not think this resort be .the negative ... - upkeep on the property be lack as far as building maintenance , cleanliness of the elevator , and upkeep of the older room .- the bed - the quality of the food - the heavy , oppressive , humid heat - the bite midge - the government 's lack of use fund properly to develop better road .i know they be receive a ton of $ $ from the grand developer who be redefine the coastline ... yet the people be beyond lack and the land be a wastelandthe positive ... - the awesome beach and coastline - the layout of the room - the friendliness of the staff - the animal wander -lrb- beautiful peacock in the lobby one day -rrb- - the privacy , no kid , secluded location - the helicopter ride back to the airport ... totally awesome !what a coastline!it be worth vacation here because it be always great to visit a new place!it 's worth it to visit a beach and a coastline not yet infiltrate by hotel after hotel after hotel !"

if the room be clean -lrb- and they be -rrb- , who care about the room ?you be in the caribbean to be outside and enjoy the beach and the weather.we be there with sunwing , and i have to say that the sunwing rep be good ; service be good -lrb- we fly out of halifax -rrb- , and the sunwing rep in dr be at the hotel every day .we do not run into any problem , but i definitely get the feeling that they be ready to help.food ************************************ i think the food be good .i definitely prefer da mario , and we eat there 4 time in we 7 day there .the buffet -lrb- window -rrb- have theme night , and several time we eat dinner at the buffet .they put on a lot of effort , and the mexican night at the buffet beat the tex-mex grill hand down.the tex-mex be so-so .people have different likes and dislikes , but as a fan of mexican food i be not impress with the offering .oddly , there be no guacamole the night we be there , although there be lot of it at the buffet mexican night a couple of evening later.the beach cafe be standard convenience food , pizza , sandwich , hamburger and the like .they usually set up some kind of bbq next to the cafe for lunch , and sometimes they have pasta , rice , etc. i do not really try it , but friend who do say it be good.breakfasts be good , lot of variety , and -lrb- for those who like it -rrb- the standard north american breakfast fare .good selection of fruit.i have beein in cuba three time , and the food definitely beat cuba .probably not as good as i have have in mexico , but close.rooms ************************************ the room be clean , but a little dated .i think you have to be careful with the patio door , since they do not seem to close very well , but that would be more of a issue on the ground floor .service be good , and we leave a little something for the maid every day .i notice that the maid use to come in the evening and turn down the bed , which be nice .lot of towel , and the room bar be stock every day .i notice that as the week go on , the maid be leave more and more beer in the fridge!a / c be a little weak , but once i figure out that you patio door need to be firmly close in order for it to work , no problems.we use the room safe -lrb- a $ 15 charge -rrb- , but have no problem with other thing leave around the room -lrb- watch , camera , etc -rrb- .we see the room in building 7 -lrb- the new buliding -rrb- , and they be very nice , jacuzzi , nice walk-in shower , larger , etc. friend we meet move over there at extra cost .someone mention that you could pay abou $ 100 pp and stay there , and depend on how important the room be to you it might be worth it .we consider move once we see they , but end up stay where we were.beaches ************************************ the beach be nice .as other people have mention , there be a lot of seaweed around ; staff at the hotel tell we that this be unusual , and be probably a reflection of the hurricane and windstorm that have happen this year .i be usually down on the beach at 6 or 7 be , and could see the team of worker who rake up the seaweed and haul it away every morning -lrb- and during the day -rrb- .not much they can do about mother nature , but they definitely work at it.no bar service on the beach .closest be the beach cafe , just up from the beach .good service.lots of kayak , windsurfer , sailboat etc on the beach .we be tell that you have to do a $ 25 course in order to be allow to take the catamaran out , but the guy at the aquatic centre just ask I if i know how to sail , and let I take the hoby out without any course .i notice several people who do not seem to have a clue about sailing -lrb- include one guy who keep try to point the boat directly into the wind to get off the beach -rrb- , but they seem to graciously get those people back on shore and out of the boat .only allow one time a day , but several time other people book boat and i go out with they since they do not know how to sail .the hoby be in good condition , and usually a good breeze .one day they take the boat off the water because it be too windy , but they usually let people go even in a stiff breeze .i give a tip here and there , and although the service be good anyway , they definitely seem to remember I a little more after a tip or two.some snorkel right off the beach , and i could usually see a few fish by the rock outcrop out along the rope .i be a bit nervous about go farther out , since the powerboat sometimes come in close to the roped-in area , but i notice several people do venture out further.pools ************************************ three pool ; the main pool , a adult pool , and another pool over by build 7 .we do not really spend much time at the pool , with the exception of one afternoon at the main pool .usually a bunch of drinker around the swim-up bar , who seem to get louder and more obnoxious as the afternoon wear on .pool be very clean and well-maintained .entertainment ************************************ the entertainment be hit and miss .due to weather we do not have the weekly beach party , so they seem to put something together on the fly .several of the show be a little racy , and i notice some parent take they kid out at some of the show .the michael jackson show be very entertaining.not bad , but i have see better , although perhaps at larger resort .this be the tail end of the season , and thing might have be wind down.excursions ************************************ do not do any .friend we meet be try to go on the catamaran trip , but after be cancel three day in a row they give up .they say it be cancel due to weather , but i think it be number .would have go on the snorkel trip , but the water be kind of churn up while we be there so decide not to.service ************************************ service be generally good .i tip -lrb- usually $ 1 -rrb- and the server appreciate it , but service be pretty good regardless .some of the bar get very busy , especially the theater bar during a show , but they be pretty efficient.drinks be good , and they will try and mix anything you like .if you ask for it they usually have premium liquor at most of the bar , especially the poolside bar .my wife be not a fan of the local vodka , so i use to ask for the good vodka when order a drink for she , but once the guy get to know I they use to do it automatically .no extra charge , but i use to tip a little bit to whoever be pour the drink .i drink the local liquor and find they to be fine .drink be a little strong sometimes , but they will tone they down if you ask.overall ************************************ we like the place .i would go again .if anyone have any specific question , feel free to email I ."

star hotel for the follow reason .to commence once we arrive at the hotel we be tell that we room be not ready , fine no problem here as we completely understand that it take time in order for the room to be clean etc. we be tell to return to the front lobby desk at 3pm .at 3pm we return to the lobby desk to be tell that yes be room be ready and that we would be on the first floor .we advise that neither couple would like to stay on the first floor -lrb- we have specifically request a 2nd or 3rd floor room -rrb- and the other couple that travel with we have two small child and didn鈥檛 want to stay on the first floor for the fear of have one of they child open the slide door and walk out .while we be await to see if we could be accommodate on a 2nd or 3rd floor we witness a complaint from a couple stay at the tropical princess that they room have be break into via the slide door .they be locate on a first floor room .we then go back to talk to the front lobby reception and be advise that all they could offer we be a room on the first floor and on saturday , the next day , they would move we to another floor .at this point a lady come out and advise the gentleman we be deal with in spanish that he could not offer we those room as those room have 鈥減roblems鈥 ?both the gentleman and the lady then disappear and once the come back they tell we that they have find another room for we on the second floor.at this point we be all very happy to know that we could finally go to we room .once we arrive at we room we discover that we have be place on the tropical princess side of the resort when we in fact be book for the caribe club princess side .it be not that this be a big issue but consider the fact that we pay more money to stay at caribe club princess we be very disappointed .we express we concern with the manager of client relation and she advise that at the moment these be the only room available .we agree to stay in these room until the follow day when we be tell something would become available on the caribe club princess side .the other couple travel with we go into they room and we go to do the same .well once i scan my card to be let into the room i discover two naked lady in the room which i have be assign .they didn鈥檛 speak a word of english and luckily the manager be still on the premise and i advise she that the front reception have issue I a key for a room that be already assign to someone else .on top of this be unacceptable behavior it be also a great security risk that the hotel doesn鈥檛 even know which room they be allot to which people .at this point i be very frustrated and this be not the dream vacation i have envision .i then go to the front reception with my friend and advise they of the trouble .they find other room for we but be unable to explain why the mistake of give I someone else鈥檚 room key happen in the first place .the room we be assign on the tropical princess side be utterly disgusting , they be outdate , the balcony door lock be break and the front door lock have be tamper with .at this point i do not feel safe in the hotel at all but tell myself that it be only for one night until they could place we on the caribe club princess side.the next day we be thankfully as promise move to two room on the caribe club princess side and i start to feel that this vacation be go to be a good one after all .well that be not what happen at all.on tuesday november 18 , 2008 we make a reservation to go to the mamma mia -lrb- italian -rrb- restaurant for dinner with the other couple we be travel with .we arrive at the restaurant and everything be go well and we all order appetizer .everyone except my husband order calamari and my husband order bruschetta .when the appetizer be deliver i see that my husband be stare at he plate .to my disbelief on he plate be a cockroach .i could not believe what i be see .we be stay at a 4 star hotel and my husband be deliver he bruschetta with a cockroach on it .not only be there a cockroach but it be dead with its leg up in the air and appear to have be cook with the cheese on the plate .at this point all of we lose we appetite and get up and leave the restaurant .we call we server to the door and advise he of what have happen .when this happen we could have make a huge scene about it but didn鈥檛 want to disgust the other patron in the restaurant .at this point we go to the buffet to have some fruit as we be all starve .after be at the buffet for a little while we be greet by the food and service manager -lrb- milton -rrb- and the chef of the mamma mia restaurant and we be apologize to .we be offer a complimentary dinner at el pescador or la cava because of we worry .we advise that we would think about it and let he know the next day .the next day while we be have breakfast milton approach we and ask if we have make a decision we advise he that we would go to el pescador that same night .that night we go to el pescador but dining at this hotel be not the same for we after we have see the cockroach .we didn鈥檛 eat the same and be disgust for the rest of we stay , needless to say that we be not able to eat normally for the rest of the week.on thursday november 20th we be approach by the concierge lady advise that the hotel have be tell of the incident and that the hotel want to offer we a dinner in compensation for what have happen , we advise she that we have already be to a dinner the previous night and that in no way do we feel compensate for what happen nor be we able to enjoy we meal since then .she ask we to please consider this and advise that if we accept this offer we would have to sign a release form which basically state that the dinner be in compensation for the cockroach be on the plate of food and that we be not to make any claim with the hotel , management or tour operator because of the situation that have occur .we advise she that we would not be sign the release form as we feel that everyone include the tour operator should be aware of the type of food that be be serve to people at this hotel .she be not very happy about this.needless to say when friday morning come we be more than happy to be leave this hotel and at the same time very upset that we spend we money go to hotel that be rate four star but yet be serve cockroach with they food.we be very disappoint with all that happen at a time when we be suppose to be rest and on vacation and because of this we will never again visit a princess resort.hope this review help someone realize this be not a sanitary place to be !"

.i must tell you first that my kid and i be club med junkie , and this be my 4th trip to punta cana and my only time outside of the club med .the only reason we leave the club med after 5 night be that i would book my trip last fall use aadvantage mile for 11 day , then come to find out afterwards that club med be close because a italian company have rent out the entire place from june 2-7 , right during the last half of my trip .so i be force to find another hotel.after , as usual , a fantastic time at cm , we arrive at the iberostar only to find out that my travel agent have book the iberostar punta cana and not the bavaro as i have request , base on traveller review here .i have read the document and assume that it say iberostar punta cana simply because that be the city it be in .also , i would make the reservation last feb. or so and simply do not remember the name of the other hotel next door when i be send the travel document a few week before departure .my biggest word of advice be to double check this -- a honest mistake make by my travel agent because the name be so innocuous .so , anyway , we arrive only to find out that we be in the other hotel , and by the face of the front desk clerk , which be consider low rent .i ask what the difference in cost be between the two and be tell $ 480 for we 5 night stay base on myself , my 18 yr .old son , and my 14 yr .old son .we ask to see a room , it look fine , and we be tell that the other hotel have much worse room and that you can not use the dining facility at the bavaro if you be stay in the punta cana or dominicana .so i get out my visa card .well , we be take to the other side of the property from where they would show we the sample room .just as close to the beach , and i do not really pay attention to the hammer go on in the group of villa nearby .mistake .every single morning , begin at 8:30 am and last till at least 7:30 pm , there be construction , drilling , hammer so loud you want to scream .it wake we up every morning , even on sunday .the room next to we and below we be also under construction so they start pound at 10 am there , but only on the first 2 day .i would have request a room change except ... i be too busy throw up the 2nd day .yes , after one meal here -lrb- dinner at the buffet -rrb- , i get horrible food poisoning the follow morning , could not leave the room all day , and finally call for a golf cart to take I to the doctor in the other hotel at 6 pm .they be very nice , give I a iv because i be so dehydrated , lot of medicine include some just in case such and such happen , tell I not to pay until i come back the next day -lrb- although they have tell I it would be a $ 90 consultation fee -rrb- .i might point out that they also could not believe it be really food poisoning , suggest that it be from travel , until i point out that i would already be in the dr for 6 day .never once have i get ill at a club med .anyway , so i go back the next morning , feel much better , to get another iv and to pay the bill .i do not need the sos pill , still in they unopened wrapper , for nausea but be unable to give they back as it be against policy from the pharmacy .so ... the grand total come to $ 272 for the hotel give I food poisoning !because it could not be prove , i have no recourse.let 's see , the plus : grounds be very beautiful , beach be beautiful , there be always food somewhere , room fairly spacious .the bartender and waiter be so happy !they be always smlie , singing , and dancing .they be definitely the best part of the place .i do not want you to think i be totally negative ... more minus , however : i have not read that man have to have pants in order to go into the sit-down restaurant .since my son ii 18 , he qualify as a man .well , it be litterally 90 degree and 94 % humidity at that time of year , so we have never bring pants .this be the same place where people be wear bikini without cover-up at lunch !so here we have 2 qualify night for the a la carte restaurant and could not use they .yes , we could have buy he some $ 70 pants in the boutique , but i be pretty feed up about have spend $ 752 by my 2nd day there .we be able to go to the steak restaurant -lrb- the only one where you do not have to wear pants that have table service -rrb- and i could only swallow 2 bite of my rib eye .shoe leather be more tender .i fear the other would be as bad , so i do not bother with the pants.the food be very plentiful , well present , and horrible .again , i hate to compare it to club med , which have fantastic food , but i feel very guilty take food from the buffet and not be able to eat it .some thing be great , but they be few far between .also , they close the beach bar at 6 pm .why?we could not do anything at night because we know that we would be awaken at 8:30 by the construction and , prior to that , the damn peacock screech at 6 am .not that the show be so good that we do not mind leave after 15 min .they be pretty bad.maid service be spotty .i request another pillow and nothing ever show up .i ask again the next day and get it .we 2nd to last day , the maid only give we 2 bath towel .i call for 2 more , and never get they .room service be prompt -lrb- when i could not leave the room , we all have stay in for dinner , not that i eat -rrb- , but the menu be very limited and they do not bring drinks.i take one step class with break down reebok step right on the side of the pool .the teacher have some woman -lrb- guest -rrb- from the u.s. teach it for she , and i do not think she ever teach a class before .plus , the real teacher do not know how to work the music , so we stop after each song .the class last 20 min .because she could not figure out the cd player .it be a blessing to end it , however.last thing : on we day of departure , we be suppose to be in the lobby at 11:35 for we shuttle to the airport .i call for a golf cart to get we luggage that never show up .finally , at 11:30 , my kid and i run with the suitcase only to find out that the bus have leave without we .after much scramble -lrb- we gogo tour rep be , naturally , in the other hotel at this point -rrb- , they find we another tour company 's shuttle who take we to the airport .i see someone there with a iberostar bracelet like ours and ask if they have be on the bus .they say yes , but that the bus have leave early and they have hold it up by get there at 11:30 .let that be another warn to you !they will leave you , even if you be early .if anything , i expect a dominican tour bus to be late , not early .that be fine , i guess , but necessary to know , especially if they just up and leave you.personally , i hate negative review .i like know that the place i want to go to be fantastic , but that be what i be lead to believe by everyone else .wrong ."

at the suggestion of many tripadvisor poster we pay the extra $ $ and get the royal service .i do not know if it be worth the extra $ $ because we do not speak with any other who be not in r -lrb- not by choice -rrb- it just seem everyone we run into be in the r area.i will not go into too much detail about the grounds as other have do a great job of that on this site already , sufice it to say , the grounds be spectacular .the pool -lrb- both royal sevice and main pool -rrb- be beautiful , the beach be keep natural and clean -lrb- and many many time we be the only one there so it be private and peaceful as well -rrb- .the room be quite spacious and for the most part comfortable -lrb- more on this later -rrb- the staff we encounter be , mostly , helpful ; of course you will encounter the employee who will not be helpful in any situation this be not the resort fault it just be the way some people be .i will add that tip be definitely expect any and everywhere we go .how much and how often you tip certainly pay a great part in how good you service was.overall , i have no major complaint about the resort staff or grounds .my issue : bath towel - be threadbare and have hole in they on more than one occasion -lrb- i would not have make a point to speak with management for one isolate incident -rrb- in deference to the staff in royal service they attempt to resolve this issue -lrb- i be there when they call -rrb- but two day later nothing have be do the dirty robe be still in we room and the towel with hole be still be place in we room .maybe housekeeping take offense to get a call from royal service ??i do not know but i be sure if the general manager have call this would problem would have be resolve and quickly.sheets - have holesbathrobes-one have a huge coffee stain run up one whole sleeve , the other have numeorus stain all over.nightly turn down service - only happen once during we stay.restaurants-paradisus tout themselves as have 6 restaurant ; of these six there be only two open during the day -lrb- one really and it be buffet -rrb- .this would not be a big deal if you have some variety in the food , but both area -lrb- they be not really separate restaurant but two connected area with different name -rrb- have the same thing day in and day out and it be usually pick over and poorly present .i swear if i have to eat fried chicken one more time i be go to cluck !there be no variety even for dessert , flan , chocolate cake , ice cream.evenings be not that much better - romantico we eat here two time during we stay not so much becasue the food be good but because the other choice bamboo be so bad -lrb- more on this later -rrb- .avocado - -lrb- which actually have good food -rrb- , be only open twice during we stay -lrb- and we be not able to get in the first day because they be book .all the restaurant be supposedly book yet we see 10 table at romantico sit empty for over two hour while we have we dinner .this be not count the table that be leave uncleaned throughout the night .and yes romantico be book the night we be there .bamboo-was a bad hibachi experience which might have be save if the staff at bamboo have offer some information on the sushi and appetizer available in the other room -lrb- even though we and another couple wait 45 + minute at we table with nothing to eat before we show begin -rrb- .i believe i see dessert on the menu but i could not tell you anything about they because after wait 1/2 hour after we meal no one come to ask if we want any we all leave .poor restaurant management ?maybe , sneaky expense management ?more likely.my observation be that corner be be cut in the food department and many many people be unhappy about it .unfortunately , none of the people i ask with say they have or plan to complain .the staff be without a clue , ask 5 of they what restaurant be open on any give day result in 5 different answer -lrb- sadly all wrong -rrb- .spa-overpriced for the service which be ho hum , nothing to write home about but certainly nothing to complain about .again tip be defintely expectedcar rental - we reserve a car week before we arrive , we check once at the resort on monday she confirm that she indeed have we reservation for the thursday return to the airport .on the wednesday we go to the avis counter to check on we car -lrb- we have nothing to do -rrb- only to find out that they have no car for we becasue they be short in sju airport so they take all the vehicle .now we be strand !the only suggestion teh woman have be that she could refer we to a local rental agency but they only have one location so we would have to bring it back to they !so what good be this do we !upon bring this to the attention of royal service staff i be tell that for $ 60 they could have the shuttle bring we to the airport to pick up a car .so now we have to pay $ 60 on top of the $ 60 per day the car be cost we just to leave this place !the least the should have do be to comp we the shuttle to the avis counter at the airport .my biggest complaint ?lack of response from sr. management these issue mention above could have easily be resolve by the manager whom we attempt to speak with on several occasion to no avail .it be so surprising to I that a hotel general manager would ask to hear they guest ' comment and even take the time to respond to these tripadvisor review but when present with the opportunity to resolve a valid issue first hand before it get to a review point ; can be so totally clueless .have mr lapp take the ten minute or to speak with we and listen to what we have to say i be sure he would have feel as do he other management personnel -lrb- who do attempt to to resolve these issue to no avail -rrb- that this be not acceptable anywhere in the world but even less in a alleged 5 * resort .we pay good money to stay here , we be ask for nothing more than what we pay for , the quality be be promise and the quantity be be promise ;

with the platinum upgrade .this be we 5th trip the punta cana , the past 4 trip stay at grand palladium bavaro .i be fairly well travel , have be a travel agent in the past.the only reason we decide to go somewhere other than gpb be to branch out and see what another hotel complex be like .we stay at gpb have be consistently amazing .i be just want to experience something different , but still have the wonderful bavaro beach and ocean !so , much of this review will compare between the 2 hotel , because that be what i know and can give my opinion on.first , this be a very large complex -- 92 acre be a lot of ground !however i would walk the large grounds at gpb , and i could get to the lobby from the beach in under 10 minute .here it be a good 25 minute walk .therefore you use the tram car to get back and forth .it be very bumpy and sometimes the driver be as crazy as the driver on the main road !get a seat can also be a challenge as people be ready to pounce on a empty seat , especially at the lobby stop .also after midnight these tram stop .we be able to get a cart ride from someone at the front entrance to the hotel , but i do not know if that be just because i show he my platinum bracelet .platinum upgrade here be most certainly worth it for the service , the room location , and the extra you get include .the amount you would pay for the cost of the massage , the motorized watersport , the dinner at licey and have room service once or twice-it cover the upgrade cost .you get premium alcohol upgrade as well .however that only help if they have the premium alcohol you want .i could not get bacardus rum there , altho if i drink scotch , i could get chivas regal .also altho only platinum member be suppose to be able to get the premium alcohol , i do see other order premium drink at the bar and they get it no question , even tho they do not have platinum wristband .the wristband be nice for platinum too-a string bracelet as oppose to the plastic amusement park type wristband everyone else get .all the other extra of be platinum be gravy above that .also i would say that if i do not have the platinum upgrade i would not reccomend this hotel at all.there be many inconsistency in the service and the food here .the time of year we travel be the start of the off season .i do not know if there be less staff or what , but i find the way we be treat to range from wonderful to indifferent .i also feel that i be in off season -- something i never experience at gpb .this feeling come from several different thing .certain alacarte we want to go to be shut down-one , which i have be look forward to as a romantic surprize for my boyfriend on he birthday dinner -- chopin-is suppose to have a boat come by with a piano player , and at time a singer .this float by you as you eat .well the night we go , we have reservation at 8 and be there till at least 1030 -- no boat , no piano-nothing .the boat be suppose to go by around 830 .we could not book mare nostrum as that be reserve for a private party the night we want it -lrb- understandable -rrb- , and the tanuki restaurant be just plain close .after read other review about these place , you want to experience they too , and then nope , you can not .we do eat at el gaucho -- tooooo noisy , busy and food just okay .beef all over hotel be generally tough .chopin-thought as a alacarte we would be serve , but this be buffet -lrb- apparently a off season thing -rrb- , mamma mia be wonderful , delicious food and server who bent over backwards .licey -- even if you do not have platinum , pay the $ 35 to eat here-it be well worth it .i wish we reservation have be for the begining of the week instead of we last night .i would have pay again and again to eat there !do not miss it !i be leary to go with the filet mignon after eat beef at the other restaurant -- but it be to die for -- cut it with a butter knife and it melt in you mouth !as to the buffet i enjoy a good breakfast-but after the 1st few day i rarely bother to make the trip , it be not worth it .from my experience , it seem if you get something cook to order at a buffet it be good , but pretty much anything else really do not have the right taste-i can not even tell you what the scramble egg on the buffet be make with because they certainly do not taste like any egg i have ever eat .the sausage be the same way .but a freshly make omelette be delicious .also , there be not many choice on the buffet .the gpb have about 5 time as many choice there as we find here .and believe I , i be not picky nor a connosieur or gourmet , i can not stress that enough so you will understand i be not be picky here .i just want something that taste good and be edible .also , even tho i be pretty careful about what i eat there so as to avoid any stomach upset , i still have 2 day with sour stomach and extra bathroom trip .unfortunately i also speak with a group of 6 other guest stay in the platinum area who eat at chopin the same evening we do and get very sick with vomit and diarrhea .apparently they all have the salmon , which we do not.room service be very good .we have breakfast and omelette and egg over easy be hot .however , it take 1 hour 30 minute and 2 phone call to get .people we meet say they have room service breakfast in 25 minute -lrb- the menu state 40 minute wait time . -rrb-also do not like that i have to call room service for ice in room -lrb- never come -rrb- .there be a set-up in the room to make cocktail , but no ice .i do not want to wait 40 minute to have a drink .gpb have ice machineshack every few building , and you serve yourself whenever you wish .all in all the food be a big dissapointment to I as i be never sure if something i be choose would make I ill or plain just not taste good and there would not be enough choice to get something else .believe I , i never have that problem at gpb .i think be the first vacation i ever lose weight .i will say a lot more staff here understand english , and there be also a lot more visitor here who speak english than at gpb .we meet a lot more people here , just strike up conversation as we go thru we day .the staff have a lot of inconsistency in how they react to guest .in the platinum lounge , we ask for a change of the rum from dark to light in we room , not a problem , they give we a full bottle of barcelo blanco for the room .another platinum guest ask to switch out the el presidente beer in he fridge with corona , and be treat rudely .we have wonderful experience at gpb-even have one waiter call we by name we 2nd year as we walk into the restaurant on we first evening .when you pass a worker at gpb - always a hola !and a smile .at the princess-very few be like that .it seem that for the most part these people be not happy to be there .in the buffet-not one server speak to we or make we feel welcome anymore than they have to in order to bring we what we need .we do see other have great waiter , who joke and laugh with they .we be easy go people who will get into conversation with just about anyone .and it be not that other have all great experience and we do not .we would experience this individually and also at time when people we meet there be with we .it be difficult to get a waitress to bring drink in the lobby .she would take use glass , get a order from all of we , and then never return .tip which we do often do not seem to make a difference.i do not like the lobby here .at gpb it be much more open and airy .also in the evening there be a band play slow dance music .it be very pleasant to sit there-you could speak with whomever you be with and not have to shout .there be very nice inside and outside space to enjoy a drink .at the princess - the show be right off the lobby .it be very loud and distracting .you be constantly say what do you say?oh one major thing i do not like -- as we sit on we balcony we be just enjoy the breeze midday and the maid be clean .we notice this day they be go to the pond by the platinum lounge and fill they cleaning bucket .okay well hmmm , i guess that okay to mop the floor -lrb- but still alittle icky -- you know pond scum and all -rrb- .we watch as the maid not only have first dip the mop and clean the floor , then she take a rag into the bucket , wring it out and clean glass for the room .oh my !needless to say we didnt use the glass in we room again !this do turn out to be a day when we find out a little later that for some reason the water be not work , only discover that because the toilet be not flushing -lrb- and of course on one of the day when i need extra bathroom trip ! -rrb-apparently this be all over the hotel , as we try to use the bathroom off the lobby with the same result .by late day tho we be able to get shower .yet no one seem very disturb by this or see cause to say anything to the guest about it that we could tell.i do have a nice vacation there , but that be all it be -- nice .not amazing.i try and make the best of whatever situation , but i be very disappoint here .after this long winded review , my opinion be that i love the platinum service part of this hotel , without it i would not ever stay there.but i do not think i would go back there though because of the food , it need to be greatly improve .if gpb have a platinum service available like that oh i would never leave there !"
2,2,2,1,2,2,2,1,"i think it be great and will be stay there again !i be read the last review on this hotel and i do not agree at all .that be why i be write this review .first of all , i be a experienced traveler and have stay in many different places.my friend and i stay here last december as a after christmas getaway .i book it on the marriott website since i be a marriott point member .i do not find the property tire at all .we room be gorgeous .maybe we get a newly remodel room but the lobby area be beautiful as well .be it in a great location to l.a beside want to be near lax ?no , of course not .it be a airport hotel .the pool be okay and the exercise room be actually pretty nice .please keep in mind this be a airport hotel .however , it be very close to santa monica and marina del rey where we go to dinner both night .i love it and will be go back again next month .i use to be a la resident for 4 year and would highly recommend this hotel but if you know nothing about l.a it be not near disneyland or universal studio .if you want to be close to disney , you need to stay in anaheim and if you want to be near universal you will have to stay in the valley some where .you be out closer to the beach area with this hotel ."
2,1,2,2,2,1,1,0,"great location !we stay for 2 night with kid .we get a amazing 2-bedroom suite !-lrb- okay it be not cheap . -rrb-we have window overlook onto the very busy street and love the atmosphere .location be right in the center of the bustling , hustle center yet window well-insulated that you could not hear a thing once close .we walk from the train station -lrb- around 10-15 min -rrb- and feel very safe , unlike what another traveler say .the weekend staff be very nice , but come sunday eve and monday , there be some very unpleasant lady at the reception who growl .why they be there at such a nice hotel be beyond I .we ask they to recommend a good and reasonale restaurant and one of they tell we to go to natalino which turn out to be overprice and underportion so maybe she get a commission .anyway , hotel be in general great , staff so-so , location be amazing ."
2,2,2,2,0,0,2,2,"apex - lovely location , a little impersonal though i have just return from a 2 night stay at this hotel and i have to say that for the price we pay -lrb- go through nectar we book via octopus travel 1000 point plus 拢155 -rrb- , it be very good value .however , i would not pay much more for a standard room.in the first instance i ring the hotel to check we booking , and i be glad i do as they do not actually know about it !i also ask whether we would be able to check in early as it be my partner 's birthday and i have book a show for 2.30 pm -lrb- normal check in be 2pm -rrb- .i be tell this should not be a problem and they would note it but to ring the hotel also on the day .i ring the hotel on the day only to be tell that i could not check in early as they do not have any of my type room available , but they be very quick to try and sell I a upgrade say that they have some of they deluxe room available .i say no as it be not in we budget and ask whether i could leave my luggage instead .i be tell that would be fine.i arrive at the hotel around midday and ask whether i could leave my luggage as we have a show to go to , and once again they try to upsell I a deluxe room -lrb- for a additional 拢20 -rrb- !!!!i feel that this be border on desperation , and consider that i have already say no , they should not have push it again , as to be honest , it make I feel a little embarrassed standing in reception .anyway , the hotel itself as other have already comment , be about a 2 minute walk from tower hill tube station - in a lovely area which be more lively during the week -lrb- due to the area mainly consist of office -rrb- , and quite quiet at weekend .most of the bar in teh area shut at weekend but there be a wetherspoon right near the hotel if you fancy a drink.our room -lrb- standard - no 613 -rrb- be very comfortable and in term of space be about average for a london 4 star standard room .the bathroom be bigger with a huge shower and a separate , but small-ish bath .there be also a speaker in the bathroom i suppose so that you can use the dvd/cd player , but ours be not work .they also clearly have not hoover the floor before we arrive as there be bit everywhere on the carpet !-lrb- yuk ! -rrb-breakfast seem to be serve in different area depend on the day of the week !at the weekend you could eat next to the reception area -lrb- but they allow smoking - which i find to be quite repulsive in such a modern hotel -rrb- , so the best area be in the restaurant section next to reception .we rate include they buffet breakfast consist of fruit , cereral , cheese , bread , pasty etc. ..which i have to say , be very good .if we have to pay for breakfast - i would not as i though for 拢13 or 拢16 -lrb- for cook -rrb- it be too expensive .there be also a a la carte breakfast menu should you desire it!one other thing that also upset we a little be becuase we have prepay prior to arrive , we be tell that on arrival we could either leave a credit card or settle any extra when we leave .however , on order a 拢1 .80 newspaper , we be leave a rather curt letter in we room say that we have to contact reception immediately with regard to we credit facility !we feel like criminal !!!!!on go down to reception we be tell it be because we have order a paper and have not leave a credit card !however this totally contradict what we have be tell when we arrive !!!!anyway , i leave my credit card detail at reception to avoid look like a thief ... after all , i do not want to be see to * steal * a 拢1 .80 newspaper !!!!!another embarrassing moment !i wonder if business people get treat the same way?so to sum up : the good bit : * spacious bathroom * great rubber duck to take home !* nice toiletries -lrb- although they be not replenish on the 2nd night after i have bag they !!!! -rrb-* nice breakfast * aircondition be effective * huge comfortable bed with goregous bed linen * the location -lrb- opposite a small park area -rrb- * free bottled water in the fridge * good stash of drink in room ; hot chocolate , coffee , tea * large tv and dvd/cd player * close to tubethe bad bit : * the reception staff be not the warmest people i have meet * i do not like be sell a upgrade room twice !* the carpet need hoover before we arrive !although room be very clean apart from this !* be make to feel like a thief/pauper by receptionwould i stay again ?yes , but only for the location and room facility .i would probably recommend this hotel more to business people as i have no doubt that they would be treat much better than we be by the reception staff ."

which seem suspicious in of itself - we be move to the ifa villa bavaro .review on tripadvisor seem fairly similar before we left.we be a group of 5 staying in 2 room .on arrival , check-in be a bit disorganized - no lineup just a bunch of people crowd around a desk .so it can be a bit frustrating if a large group be ahead of you .i tell the reservation that we reservation be 2 room .we be not give adjacent room - in fact they be not even close to each other .my initial room be 1224 - so far away that they have a golf cart tram to take you there .i would say walk it be 500m away from the main reception and another 300m or more to the beach .-lrb- they do have another shuttle to the beach although it be a nice walk there -rrb- .on check in to the room - no towel , no toilet paper .a phone call be make - it come 2 hour later .luckily i have bring my own.the room i would say be 3 * in quality .they have a nice 27 plasma tv with lot of channel -lrb- satellite -rrb- - include multilingual .unfortunately some of the hotel channel keep show graphic porn so if you be channel surf it can be a bit annoying .there be no wi-fi in the room - they say there be dsl cable on the tv for internet but when you call the front desk they say no .the only internet be this small hut where you have to book time in advance -lrb- $ 1us for 30minute -rrb- - 2 computer .i book time everyday .but slot be always full .i usually book the day before.there be no toiletries .no kleenex or tissue .there be a dispenser on the wall with 3 slot but only one of the slot be fill with a white liquid .shampoo ?soap ?the other room -lrb- my sister 's -rrb- the dispenser be broken.the bed be fine - and i think the shower be very nice .no bathtub.housekeeping be variable .sometimes they come in the morning , sometimes not until the evening .towel be take out separately in the morning and new one be provide in the afternoon or early evening .so there be no towel in the room mid-day .on the second day we insist on be move to a closer room and be move to room 1089 - much closer and this improve we enjoyment more.air conditioning be hard to control but we be glad to have it - it could either be too cold if leave on -lrb- even though there be a thermostat -rrb- or too hot if leave on .ceiling fan as well but rather noisy .no clockradio in the room so bring you own.small fridge which be replenish with 2 medium size bottle of bottled water daily.ice bucket but never see a ice machine while we be there .small clothesline outside be a nice touch for you wet stuff - 2 patio chair and a small table as well .many people leave stuff overnight .but my sister have a towel steal and i actually have a towel take -lrb- which be later return -rrb- as well so leave out at you own risk.we tip we housekeeper every day and at the end and it be much appreciate .the beach be very very nice and we walk to it .lot of lounge chair never a problem but we be morning people .around the pool -lrb- 3 gorgeous pool -rrb- , the towel reservation system be work .never bother by people sell stuff i do not think they be allow .spa people gently approach you at time on walkway but not a issue at all .at the beach - lot of topless sunbathing.this resort be almost exclusively european .english be hardly speak here and i would say it be primarily people from france , italy , germany , and spain who be there we week .some staff speak basic english but i would not try anything conversational .some reception staff do not speak english.drinks be super sweet and not premium alcohol .pina colada come out of a machine and be highly variable depend on where i get it .sometimes it be like a ice drink , other time it be a warm drink , i think the coffee bar/cafe serve the best drink and coffee .the food to I be the worst part of this resort and i like everything .breakfast be fine .entertaining omelette guy .it be hard to mess up breakfast .at the main restaurant they have a pasta bar and a grill area .we enjoy that .but the food be just adequate .i would say at the level of a high school cafeteria .or so .the most disappointing restaurant experience be the a la carte restaurant .you must make reservation in advance .the oriental restaurant be a beautiful room but portion be small and we could have eat more afterwards .some of the meat be tough .the mexican restaurant be buffet style and reasonable in quality but a confusing layout create two way buffet traffic and the grill seem overwhelm .the caribe restaurant serve beautiful look food that taste fine but we food be cold when it arrive .another group go to the buffet after caribe and say they meat be tough.i get a bit of traveller diarrhea towards the end of the week and my mother a mild case when she return home.the gym be quite good - i be surprise .weight machine - 2 treadmill , 2 elliptical , 2 bike , free weight , mat .air condition .i do not go into the spa but the entrance be the same as the gym and be very nice.i do water aerobics and stretch on the beach with the animation crew .the first couple day the stretch on the beach be excellent .the second day he hand over he duty to this girl who basically make thing up as she go along -lrb- stretch each finger ? -rrb-and quit after 20 minutes.evening entertainment be hit and miss .my parent enjoy the musical show -lrb- which start at 10pm -rrb- .there be one night where they do a miss ifa villa bavaro contest with people from the audience that some might consider offensive - it include have the woman simulate lap dancing on a man from the crowd who be tie up .and although i have leave by then , later on there be a racially insensitive skit involve ask one of the contestant to act like a chinese person and give some prop - be of asian descent i be glad i be not there but my brother-in-law do speak to the manager the next day -lrb- nothing happen -rrb- .i believe another review on tripadvisor allude to this skit.local call be not free - we make four rather quick local call and end up pay $ 13us .we be tell the rate before we make the call but they have a very suspicious exchange rate and really you do not have much say unless you take out peso which i would not recommend.checkout be straightforward for we .we pre-arranged airport transfer be no problem at all .however , a nice couple i meet actually miss they flight because checkout take so long at the hotel .i do not get the exact detail - we have a brief conversation at the airport - but he be furious - and it seem like a large group be either check out in front of them.the grounds of this resort be beautiful .absolutely beautiful .in layout , in maintenance and in cleanliness .just wonderful .this resort have the potential to make itself into a 4 * or 5 * resort if it upgrade the food and the room .i think all the staff be wonderful , hard working and polite .-lrb- we tip everywhere though - every meal , every drink , housekeeping - and we certainly do not see much tip go on -rrb- i would stay at this resort again if i know that the room be upgrade and if i know that the food have improve .if i be to return i would not bother with the a la carte restaurant .-lrb- note that they do have nicer room but we be tell we would have to pay extra and that sunscape/allegro do not pay for we to be in those room . -rrb-"

temperature be actually warmer than the pool water and the beach be well take care of and clean daily by staff .the staff there be friendly and always courteous and always attempt to provide for you need to the best of they ability .we favorite restaurant be the gourmet restaurant and they service and four entree offer be excellent .the only consistent complaint i would have about the restaurant be that coffee be not readily available .the server would usually pour a half cup and many time it be prepoured and frequently not hot when it be serve .-lrb- i wonder if the availability of coffee bean be affect by previous storm as i never notice this at my stay in puerto plata several year ago . -rrb-unfortunately the weather during we stay be not ideal with lot of cloudy day and frequent heavy rain that make you entire vacation experience less than ideal .the hotel have no control over the weather but the little annoyance that you may not have notice become more pronounced when you be spend more time wander around the resort in the rain .be prepare to wear rubber sole sneaker as the beautiful tiled hallway and walkway be extremely slippery when wet especially during downpours.i do not want to sound like a complainer but would like to comment on some issue i encounter so that other guest may be able to avoid they in the future and enjoy they stay more .room it be a standard jr. suite in building 4 which be a ground floor room with we balcony face the construction area that be block by a black net .the construction work do start early and several night go late probably try to make up for lose hour due to heavy rainfall .-lrb- noise be a issue if you choose to use the patio but not hear inside room -rrb- the room be very large and we have no issue with the layout of this suite .the bed be fine but the pillow could be improve .the sofa be not comfortable -lrb- if you be sit in the sun this would not be a issue -rrb- and the fabric cover it and the bench appear dirty due to old stain .the increase moisture and ground floor location also contribute to increase number of centipede/inchworm type creature find inside we room throughout we stay .-lrb- the room be clean excellent by staff so cleanliness be not the contribute factor here . -rrb-we be unfortunately assign a room that have a door that would accomodate guest that want adjoining room .the door be extremely hollow and we could hear conversation of the guest in that room as if they be sit right next to you .circumstance have one family with children/baby cry which be tolerable but the last night we be awaken to new drunken guest scream and cursing at each other several time during the night .when we check in we be tell that the hotel be fully book so we do not request a room change .i would recommend request room on upper floor and not accept adjoing door suite to eliminate the problem i experience .entertainmentthe animation team work hard but i only do two dancing lesson as daytime activity .i do use the gym but be disappoint that the treadmill keep shut off on I after manually try to increase speed to increase my pace .i choose to walk around the perimeter of resort for exercise but that be interrupt by heavy downpour .the show at night be not impressive and it seem like the only other choice of entertainment be the sax and keyboard player who be good but it do become a little repetitive after two night .no activity available during rain that we be aware of .medical emergenciesdo not travel to punta cana unless you be independently wealthy or have travel insurance that cover unanticipated illness .my husband become violently ill with a bacterial gastrointestinal illness .i do not think it matter how or where he pick up this bacterium but i can assure you he have travel all over the world include many third world country and know standard precaution to take to avoid these type illness .the hotel md be a pleasure to deal with and be very competent .my husband be send to private hospital for iv antibiotic and fluid by ambulance .the cost of these service be $ 400 and charge to my credit card .i just by chance remember that i have purchase travel insurance for the first time due to threat of hurricane and be pleasantly surprise that it cover medical emergency too .the hotel doctor do tell I to have the hospital contact the insurance company which i do when i arrive .the billing person keep tell I they do not take any we travel insurance but i insist they call prior to give they my credit card for guaranteed payment prior to treatment .she then inform I the insurance would pay but again want my credit card which i be reluctant to present .the hospital be very clean and of course we do have some communication difficulty as we do not speak spanish fluently but nothing insurmountable .the biggest problem be try to be discharge as they want guaranteed payment but be not accept verbal and written confirmation of payment by insurance company and appear to be insist on charge my credit card as oppose to insurance payment guarantee .i actually speak to insurance case manager several time via telephone and she say they have never encounter this before and she have deal with same facility on prior occasion .as we finally leave the hospital i observe another frustrated family deal with same issue of insurance guantee that we have .i recognize that this facility do not want vacationer to disappear without receive payment but when they be deal with internationally know insurance company there have to be a better way to a confirm coverage without cause patient and they family the increase stress .i would have be willig to use my credit card if that be procedure to get reimbursement from insurance company but they state they already guarantee payment and i do not want to be double bill for service .i also be not able to receive a write itemized list of supplies and cost of service when we leave hospital.i think a variety of circumstance such as the rainy weather , less than ideal room location , one bad meal result in bacterial infection and hospital experience will not bring I back to punta cana in the near future .if i do choose to return and want a quiet relaxing vacation and could be guarantee a upper level floor without adjoining door i would try the majestic again as it really be a magnificent property .suggestion to the management team at the majestic would be to make sure you have information and map of property in english and other languague for new arrival guest .also it would be a great if they actually have drink menu at the bar so guest could experiment with new drink and know what type of beverage be available and ingredient in they ."

-rrb-.they promise to fix it , but after wait for 20 minute , we decide to give up on that idea.facilities : very nice , but some construction go on as part of the transition .it do not bother we too much , but there be some jack-hammering during the day which do not mix too well with the serene atmosphere of a beach resort .overall this resort will be great once all of the problem mostly cause by understaffing and renovation be address , but the experience we have be somewhat dissapointing.the rate be great , but after stay there , we understand why this resort be mysteriously price substantially lower than all the other resort in the island ..."

it be actually right on the beach .large slide glass door open to a patio with a table and two huge lounge chair which be actually connect to the sand .the view be incredible and it be so nice just to open you door and be right on the beach .the sand be a fine golden color and the water nice and blue ;

all complimentary .we even ask if they have fresh coconut and ten minute later it show up beautifully slice and delicious .keep in mind , this be all at no charge .so while the price may be a bit high-end , all the goody come along with it .another typical complaint be that not much english be speak .well , duh !it be a spanish speaking country !the world do not revolve around american .even so , take a few minute to make a attempt at spanish and you will be treat extremely well .there be enough english speak staff that communication be really not a problem .we really enjoy take long beach walk every day .this be a perfect beach for a long walk with fine sand and warm gentle water .walk to you right when face the ocean and you can go for quite a while .plus , eventually you will pass the excellence resort with its military bunker styling and be glad that you do not stay there .right next to the excellence there be a small string of shop that be good for souvenir , island jewelery , cigar , etc. if you ask , they will even bring you back a cold six-pack of the great local beer , presidente .-lrb- oh - here be a tip .if you leave a few dollar and a note for the evening housekeeper , she will stock you up with water and a few bottle of beer which magically do not show up on we bill ! -rrb-the spa at agua be just right - nice atmosphere for massage and a really interesting circuit pool with all kind of neat thing like a hot tub , cool slab with water jet , a waterfall , water massager , a mist shower , etc. very fun to hang out there .to wrap it up , if you be look for a mega-resort with beach volleyball , water aerobic , obnoxious music blast on the beach and gob of free food and alcohol , the agua be not for you .but of you want a incredibly indulgent vacation , relish in the fact that there be not much to do except relax among incredible architecture with fantastic service , this may be you hotel .no question they be still work out a few kink , but it do not seem to matter at all .the service always make up for the few problem we encounter .they try very hard to get everything right , and definitely succeed .we will be back !"

0,0,0,2,0,2,2,1,"love ocean blue i be late get in my review , we go on we trip june 7-19th .there be 7 of we .we have 3 room .first i want to say i will never fly with american airline again .we have trouble with we connect flight from miami to punta cana .we spend one and a half hour wait to see if we flight would be cancel .one of the bathroom be not work , so they say .the staff at american be rude , do not want to answer question and do not make any announcement over the loud speaker .once the bathroom be fix we still wait , they finally admit one of the stewardess call in sick and they be wait for a replacement .my 7 year old be cry because he think we flight would get cancel .we finally make it to punta cana a couple of hour late .at the airport we pose for picture and pick up we bag and go to we hotel .check in be quick then the time share lady be all over me.two of we room be full of mold .i share a room with my son and my 30 year old nephew .all 3 of we have asthma and mold be all over the wall and even the art work on the wall .the dresser also smell of mold .i do not care what anyone tell you .they be lie if they say this be normal because it be a hot country near the water .i have be to jamaica 10 time and to mexico 6 time .there be not suppose to be mold or mildew in you room , nor any kind of bug and this include ant .if people want to be surround by dirt and bug on vacation they could just go camping .it be the resort duty to spray the grounds and room and do what-ever they have to do to keep they clean .anyway i send my nephew to the front desk to ask for another room .we be tell we would have to wait until the next day .my nephew talk to the manager and explain that with we asthma sleep in that room could kill we but he be tell that all the room be full until the next day .my friend in the other room with the mold be tell the same thing .i look around the room for a place to set out some clothes for my little one .i end up put a towel on the closet floor and lie out we clothes on that .the next day my friend be move to a new room .this room also have lot of mildew .they ask for another room on the second floor .they get it , so they end up move 3 time .we call about we new room and be tell none be available .i explain again that be in that room could kill all of we but they say there be nothing they could do and that the manager would not be in until the next day .that night my nephew have a bad asthma attack but i have make he bring he deep breathing machine and after use that he feel better .the next day i be at the front desk bright and early look for the manager .he explain that everyone want to be closer to the pool and beach and that all the room have be take the day before move those people .well i guess i look as if i be go to explode because i have to shut my eye and count to ten before i could say another word .i tell he that he move people to be closer to the pool when three people could have die in they sleep because of they asthma .thing move quickly then and he move we himself to a upgrade room .it be beautiful and after that we be all determine to enjoy we stay.i love the building in the square .everything be there .at some resort the restaurant be spread all over the place , which mean lot of walk but here all of they be close together.it do not do we much good because by the time we get to the square each night the wait be too long to get into any of the restaurant .we do get to eat at the mexican and like the food there .my nephew find that at route 66 if you tell they you just want take-out they would let one person in to order and wait for the food .he would do this most night and take the tram back to the room with the food .he could even bring we back ice-cream this way without it melting .there be a wonderful vibe to the resort .the staff and the guest be very friendly .most guest wave and say hello when you pass by .one of my friend and i go on the outback safari .we love this as it give we a chance to see the country side and meet the people .we really love see the local kid ride they horse and donkey and wave hello at we .the beach they take you to for boogie board be cover with trash which be too bad but itha a beautiful view.i think the pool be big and there be lot of kid for my son to swim with everyday .i do not enjoy the beach that much .i think it be small and sometimes it be hard to get a place in the shade .also on the beach some of the lounger in the shade be place 4 or 5 in a row and you would end up lie next to stranger who might not want you be that close to they .i feel uncomfortable one day have to lay next to this one couple who clearly do not want I there in what they hope would be a romantic time alone .overall we have a good time at this resort and i would go there again and tell my friend to go there .at the airport on the way home there be a new part of the airport that be air condition .my friend fly a different airline and they gate be in a different place and they say they have no air .so if you have a long wait for you flight look for this area .there be some shop in there also for booze and cigarettes.the trip home on american be a nightmare .we flight be late leave punta cana and late get into miami .then we wait for a disabled plane to be tow from we gate and after wait 20 minute until it be do they decide to move we to a different gate anyway .this gate be way across the airport from immigration and custom .one of we bag be the last one off the plane so we be behind everybody and when we finally make it to we gate american say because check we bag again would take too long we would have to miss we flight home to detroit .the lady say they would not pay for a hotel for we overnight because it be we fault that it take so long to get through immigration and custom .again i have to close my eye and count to ten .i ask for a supervisor and have to go downstairs and wait in a long line behind other people who have miss they flight .i know that everything that happen with these plane in document in they computer and the supervisor look up we flight and could see everything that happen .so they give we a free room -lrb- dump -rrb- for the night at the airport and first class ticket for the fight home the next day but nothing for food .but it ment fly to chicago and then on to detroit .after we board the plane in chicago we sit on the runway for a hour wait for a thunder storm to leave detroit .while we sit there a big storm hit the airport in chicago .lot of nail bite on we part about this flight get cancel and the pilot say he think it would , but finally he say to hurry up and buckle up so we could take off before they change they mind .i try to save money by take american instead of leave a few day sooner on a charter flight with apple vacation .usually charter be always cheaper with apple but not this time .i could have take the charter because it cost a arm and a leg buying airport food and i spend a lot try to calm my son both way with pizza and ice cream and anything else he want .this be why i always buy travel insurance and believe I i have put in a claim and send they all of my receipts.again the ocean blue be good value for the money , just insist that you get a decent room ."

departure.check-in : amazing service on arrival .we have a vip/honeymoon package so they assign someone from the guest service desk to assist we for the check-in .take we aside and make all we a la carte reservation right away include a special honeymoon romantic dinner at the seafood restaurant.room : we end up in 2217 -lrb- block 2 , 2nd floor , room 17 -rrb- which face the pool in front of the towel hut and pool bar .great location as it be not too close from the swim up bar where the activity take place but close to everything include lobby and restaurant but only a short walk to the beach .room itself be beautiful with jaccuzi .as per we vip/honeymoon package , we receive a bottle of white wine and some finger food at the room the first 2 night -lrb- around 5pm -rrb- , a fuit basket and champagne on arrival and a breakfast in bed on tue morning .amazing.restaurants : this be where the resort lack a little bit in quality .the buffet be pretty varied and offer some very good item .the a la carte be somewhat comparable to all other resort we have visit .the japanese be pretty good but be also pretty typical with 8 folk sit around the cooking table where the chef prepare the food and then serve everything at once on a plate .the steakhouse be pretty good also other than they cook everything early and re-heat the food as necessary -lrb- this be why you steak arrive in about 10 min ... -rrb- .do not go there at 10pm as you will get the leftovers -lrb- we do that one night and the brochete be overcooked and hard -rrb- .we romantic dinner be at the seafood and we be assign we own server with a nice table at the edge of the pool .we didnt ' get to pick the food but end up with some gamba and small beef filet which be ok .carribean/mexican be not great but offer variety .again , overall , lot of choice but i would not compare the food to a sandal as far as quality .but the important thing here be we do not get sick and do not loose any weight ... lol!beach / pool : amazing .always room under palapa and plenty of chair regardless of time of day .we do the beach in the morning and pool in the afternoon and never a problem .pretty windy on the beach the last couple of day so sand everywhere so we stick to the pool more .never a problem exchange towel either -lrb- we do 2 or 3 time a day -rrb- .activity : typical stuff go on at the beach but mostly near the swim up bar .this be where everyone would go for a drink and watch around 4pm everyday .show : again typical .we watch 3 night .the best be the michael jackson .other night be the typical guy against girl , mister majestic etc. ..sad thing be that the show do not start until 10pm , very late ... disco : we manage to stay up one night and make it to the club where everyone end up right after the show be over -lrb- around 11pm -rrb- .only carribean music but a good crowd on hand when we went.gym : not bad for a resort gym .there be ac but the door be always be open by some curious folk so it do get warm.there be a attendant there who look after the eqpt/towels etc. ..he be constantly near you as you be work out so it can be a bit annoying .lot 's of bikes/treadmill and some free weight and nautilus eqpt so you can have a decent workout.service : well , i be go to choose my word carefully -lrb- as my wife say ... so not to offend anyone here -rrb- .i be only indicate this as to offer advice for those who be seek a resort with a specific clientele and staff .first off there be a issue with english speak staff .most do not understand english at all although the guest service staff be incredible and fluent in english .however , most server or shop attendant do not speak much english .lucky for we we also speak french and some of those do too so we manage .the lady at the mini-mart be extremely serious , never smile and get offend when my wife be look at t-shirt -lrb- unfold they to see the logo ... -rrb- .additionally , most of the customer be spanish speaking .again , not try to offend anyone here .i believe that this resort cater to those folk a bit more as the majority be spanish speaking .this be perfectly acceptable and might not be something the resort be look for originally .it be not a big issue for we but if you be a french speaking person from quebec city who do not speak english or spanish , you might wan na reconsider .for we , we manage well and still have a good time relaxing .just do not meet that many foks.check out : very quick .check out at 1200 hr .on the bus within the hour .airport check-in do in about 30 mins.overall : we have a very good , relax honeymoon which be exactly what we want .however , i do not think we would go back to this resort .again , the issue of staff and clientele be very surprising to we and different from other resort we have visit where we have meet many different people .surprisingly , there be many , many kid at this resort which be not really indicate in the review .although kid be allow , we think that this be mostly a adult type resort .obviously , family be choose this resort more and more which be very ok as it be very a nice place.the resort itself be beautiful , service in most case be above average but some area as indicate above could be improved.hope this can help some of you in select you dream vacation ."

anything you would need .i will admit that i pick this hotel mainly for its location and i be not at all disappoint in that regard.the staff , too , at least the one i have encounter so far , have be nothing but friendly , helpful and gracious .nothing all that exceptional , but definitely everything you would hope for .i do not fault they one bit.howeverunderneath this sleek exterior be a whole wealth of aggravatingly poor design and planning .the bed , for example .it look beautiful the way they make it up and very invite after a arduous cross-atlantic flight .it be quite bouncy , good for jump , i would imagine , and i be seriously not at all picky about bed - i will happily dream away on the hardest of futon mattress - but i can actually feel the spring poke up through the skimpy cushioning and i can not fall asleep for more than a few hour without one of my limb fall asleep .this morning i notice a bruise on my hipbone from lie on one side for too long .my neck and shoulder ache something fierce and i now understand why they put little note card everywhere advertise in-room massage .after sleep on they bed , you will need one.my second major complaint : the lighting in the room .there be not enough of it .and what little there be be so infuriatingly poorly position it make I want to scream .in the lobby , the poor lighting feel moody and seem almost appropriate .but there be no excuse for what they have manage to do in the room .there be three recessed overhead light , one directly above -lrb- maybe slightly behind -rrb- the head of the bed , one directly above the sink and one above and slightly in front of the toilet .there be also a desk lamp on the desk , some sort of lighting inside the closet and a coil of christmas light behind the headboard that serve only to add atmosphere .that sound like enough , do not it ?well , the desk lamp be perfectly functional , i will not complain about it .and the atmospheric closet and bed light do what they set out to do well enough .but the light above the bed be point in such a way so as to blind you should you want to read in bed lie on you back and if you should try to turn over and lie on you stomach , it take some real effort to position yourself and the book in such a way that the page be illuminate .and it also somehow fail to sufficiently light the side of the room it be responsible for .the light over the sink also point straight down , cast shadow on the face , make it impossible to see in the mirror .i catch a reflection of myself in the mirror of a well-lit bathroom yesterday and i absolutely look like a clown , have apply too much blush and crooked eyeliner .and my boyfriend keep cut himself shave .the third overhead light , over the toilet be totally mysterious to I .it allow you to see the floor in front of you perfectly , and somehow fail to pour any of its light into the shower , make it the darkest single corner in the room .i simply do not understand it.speaking of the bathroom , it certainly look very pretty and modern and spotlessly clean .but if anyone anywhere in the hotel flush they toilet while you happen to be in the shower , the water turn scalding hot for a good 10 seconds .the showerhead be on one of those pole where you can slide it up and down to you desire height , which seem quite nice until you realize that there be no way to make the showerhead stay where you have put it and have to do a kind of dance in order to remain in the stream of water .and the shower have no door or curtain , only a panel of glass 2 or 3 foot wide that do nothing to prevent the entire bathroom from get wet.the wall be very thin and poorly soundproof and , even though i think i have book a executive room on a high floor with view over the city , i be instead lucky enough to be assign a -lrb- cheaper , smaller -rrb- room overlook a playground where child can be hear scream until well past midnight.i have a few other smaller complaint , like the food we order from room service late last night be pretty bad , though admittedly very prompt and convenient at 4 in the morning when we could not sleep , the air conditioner be rig so that it turn off when you leave the room , mean you always come back to a room that be hot and stuffy , and the rooftop pool , albeit totally picturesque , do not have nearly enough seat to accommodate the number of hotel guest who want to spend time there , and from what i can tell , all the seat be snag up early in the day by the middle-aged british tourist who sit there all day swill they wine and discuss they asset -lrb- i be not even be facetious - at the pool today i overheard two distinct group of people discuss they vast finances -rrb- and , at least for I , stand room only and people twice my age act half as mature make enjoy a glass of wine on the rooftop at sunset more or less impossible.i have not be to the gym yet , but i pass by it today and it look like all the equipment be brand new and , like the rest of the hotel , it be very clean .same go for the business center.in short , it seem to I that what you be pay for when you book a room at the grand hotel central be the decor , the location and the courteous staff .everyone and everything be nice and pretty .but take all that away and you be leave with a hotel i would not spend $ 60 a night to stay in , let alone 200 euro .this hotel have everything you could possibly desire , except for what be most important : bed you can sleep on , shower you can shower in and functional lighting - pretty serious oversight in my book ."

0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,"terrilbe/non-existent management be the downfall of the hotel my wife and i have be to the domican republic several time before , and even get engage there , so i feel we have a good sense of what can be expect in this country .in fact , we have a soft spot for the dr. we be on a family trip this time , celebrate a aunt and uncle 25th anniversary with both we parent and sibling .the occidental have some positive , but overall we experience have so many negative aspect to it that i doubt we will ever return to the dominican .i will start with the positive : the hotel layout be nice , the staff do a good job of keep thing clean.the bartender do a admirable job of hustle despite the fact very few people tipthe late night pizza -lrb- available until 6 am -rrb- be surprisingly goodthe club mangu be by far the most happen club we have ever see in the dr sadly - on to the negativesthe first problem we encounter be with the quality of we room .we room have 2 twin bed push together -lrb- rather than a king which would be more appropriate for a married couple -rrb- , non functional ac , a non functional fan , and a shower that be better describe as a slow drip that alternate between ice cold and scaldingly hot .we be pretty miserable this first night , since neither the ac nor the fan work .we subsequently find out we have be allocate a non renovate room .the rest of we group have all be allocate renovate room .get move to a renovate room end up be a major challenge .we keep be inform a manager be not around and they could not move we without approval from one of they , finally , when a manager do arrive the nect morning , he try to stay back in he office and have the reception attendant try to pass message back and forth .it make we feel ridiculous .we insist on speak to the manager directly .he try to say the resort be full , which be a complete lie -lrb- later we find out they be at 60 % capacity -rrb- , and that no renovate room be available .this be after see many many people wheeling suitcase from all the different building all over the resort that morning to check out .finally , after 3 more trip to the reception culminate with ask for a meeting with the general manager , a renovate room finally magically appear for we .there really be no reason for the situation to get to this point , however .give there be 4 problem with we room and there be plenty of room available , we should have be move immediately .we experience with the management on this issue , or lack of since the manager be rarely available , be repeat in other scenario several time over the remainder of the trip.the staff often have a stop bother we , we be just chill attitude .for example , the day before we leave i be try to find out what time we bus would pick we up for the airport .i be inform i have to speak to the person that coordinate the bus , and that they be currently in the back of the lobby .i go to try to find they , they be not there .when i tell this to the rep at the front desk , i be tell they might be at the theatre now , but in any case would be around the property for a couple more hour and i should just wander around try to find they .this be pretty annoy the day before we have to leave , and i want to get back to the beach .i ask they to just find the person coordinate the bus themselves , or make a phone call to find out the bus time and just send a message to we room with the time .although this experience be not so terrible in its own right , i think it just show the pervasive attitude of the staff.there be a constant stream of people complain about various thing at the front desk , which create a negative atmosphere and quickly erode we confidence in how thing be be run .the food be not good .a consensus quickly emerge that the buffet be the best choice -lrb- as oppose to the specialty restaurant -rrb- .it be a interesting phenomenon to see all the restaurant nearly empty but a line out the door for the buffet .most of we have issue in the bathroom from the second day onward.the reception staff , and lack of constant manager presence , leave guest with the impression there be nobody to turn to about problem .a quick example here , i be work out in the fitness room one afternoon .the employee on duty approach I and ask I where i be from , after which he tell I that god be number one for he and ask where he rank for I .he then tell I he be a christian , etc. i be a bit at a loss at how to respond but i just smile and return to my workout .after this exchange he proceed to go to the corner of the fitness room and chant various prayer at the top of he voice i spiritu sankti , etc. this go on for the next 20 minute of my workout .after the earlier frustration at the front desk , i think if i tell they this story they would just laugh about they funny colleague , so i never ever bother to tell anybody about it .another negative be the quality of the nighttime entertainment .we actually have very low expectation from we previous trip .however , the occidental take thing to a new low .for example , one night the mc spend 45 minute play the i be thinking of a number between 75 and 95 game and then 120 - 140 after the first one be guess and so on and so on .we have a problem with the staff ignore the do not disturb sign .twice , they walk on on we take a nap.a final issue i will discuss be not completely the hotel fault , although they play a role .we ask at the concierge how we could book deep sea fishing .they recommend a company .we speak to the owner in person and arrange a very specific deal .we want to keep all the fish we catch , have it clean by the staff and then have it cook at a local restaurant .he quote a price for this type of package , and tell we that a friend of he that own a restaurant have agree to cook the fish as a favor as long as we buy drink and side order from he restaurant .we go out and catch 2 large mahus mahi that we take back to shore after which we have a series of unpleasant episode .first , the boat staff tell we they usually get to keep the fish , or at least one fish .so we have to argue about the fact we already have agree with the owner to keep all the fish .then , none of the staff want to clean the fish without additional tip , although we have already discuss this point with the owner as well .finally , the restaurant owner tell we he would not cook the fish unless he get to keep all the extra fish we could not eat on the spot -lrb- this be no good because we promise cook fish to we wife and girlfriend -rrb- .so it make we feel like everybody be constantly try to scam we and take a piece out of we on every possible chance .we finally get the fish cook at another small local place nearby for a reasonable sum , but we should not have have to pay anything more since we have be very exact in we negotiation .the owner of the boat be not available for all this time for anybody to call .despite for success of the trip in term of the fish , we actually return really bum out about the dr since we feel everybody be try to scam we .we resolve not to leave the resort for any other trip .i would really suggest avoid leave the resort .finally , it actually end up be a funny joke to we , but the staff manage to incorrectly spell happy 25th anniversary on the cake we order for my aunt and uncle !to conclude , i would just avoid the occidental .in order to improve matter at the property , i think they would have to completely overhaul the management and rethink how they organize everything at the hotel ."

luggage get load and for $ 28 , off we go .the trip there be a eye opener .we see many moped with more than two people on they , which be a hoot , extreme poverty and the taxi driver pass each other right and leave .it be shall we say ... interesting , lol.we arrive at the resort after approx 45 minute and hubbie go to check we in .he soon beckon I into the reception area .the receptionist and everyone behind the desk do not speak english .usually , in the past , i have just give my name , and the reservation be find .this be not the case , i have to give they my copy of expedia 's

smaller one , which be a unexpected surprise .the bathroom be all marble .yes , the shower door may not close 100 % completely , but really be not a big deal .the adjustable shower head be great ,

time , what be you go to do ?i guess if you never open the slider and keep the air on , it would be better , but i love the ocean breeze , so everytime we be in the room , we keep the slider open

beer , five water bottle , two large pepsi 's and two large sprite 's .my father 's room do not have the liquor , so we figure the person who stay in we room before we , must have be on the deluxe plan and leave they stuff , as oppose to we jr. suite plan .the room be identical , it be just the amenity that be different .we tip the maid three to five buck every day and receive four packet of coffee , six or more water , pop and beer replenish , clean towel twice a day , etc. my father have flower petal almost daily in he room , on the bed and in the bathroom , but we never see that.the courtyard for each building be different , most with beautiful water feature , it be definately a nice walk to see they all .in the lobby of each building be a concierge desk .i have read review that say this be where we make dinner reservation , and we try to do this , but again , the woman speak no english , and only point to the elite sign .after six night i still have no idea what a elite member be , perhaps the people that own timeshare there ?we eat at the buffet the first night .until the last morning , we never have a problem find a table for five , set up with glass , silverware and napkin .the food be fine .not the best , not the worst , and there be something for everyone .with the number of people they have to serve , and from so many different place , the selection be fine .now , the service on the other hand be completely touch and go .sometimes a server would come over and ask for drink order .typically we would order water and pop right away , before even get up for the buffet .there be many time we would ask several time before get serve and sometimes we would get the water immediately and sometimes never .they move at they own pace and do they own thing , and there appear to be no rhyme or reason .we find the easiest way to get around we thirst be to go and get fresh juice from the buffet , which by the way be awesome !they have banana , watermelon , papaya , pear , etc. breakfast , lunch and dinner daily be all the same , food and service.one annonying thing i thuoght i would mention .they have people stand in the lobby of the buffet welcome you .you think it be just that right ?employee welcome you to the restaurant .but no , it be timeshare hawker who will bother you on the way out .i think that really unfair .i have to deal with they all week at the beach , pool and lobby , so to hit I up inside the restaurant i just feel be a sleazy tactic.we eat at several of the restaurant for diner , by far the nicest one be the one we pay extra for , el bodegon .we have great wine and great steak there .it also be never full , when we be there only four other table be full and we have great conversation with the other people .we never get into the italian rest .after numerous try , the wait be just ridiculous .we talk to some people who wait three hour and never get sit , go back two day in a row , and never be able to get a seat .the buffet and rest by the beach be awesome for both lunch and dinner .for lunch , you could be in a bathing suit and bare foot , but for dinner the whole atmostphere change , nice linen , pants and shoe have to be wear , etc. the coffee/pastry shop be awesome for after dinner drink and desert .the mexican food look horrible , but taste great .the american place wak pretty good .we be never up past nine or ten so never make it to a show or to the disco .we be just plum wear out , lol.the lobby bar be nice and always crowd , after dinner .the live music be a nice touch , although we still can not figure out at a dominican resort , with a small percentage of american traveller , why they choose to sing many 70 's we ballad .although listen to they sing they version of we old song bring many smiles.we mostly live at the pool .i be one of the first people up for the day .so it be always interesting to watch other wake up , still in they pajamas come and stake out they chair .one minute there be only a couple of people mill about , and the next it be like a bunch of ant , move here and there , set up they chair with towel , move the heavy umbrella around and then leave again .it really be pretty humerous .i see no one fight over chair or even remove anyone 's stuff , but then again , the first five day of we trip , there be not a ton of people there .the last night , friday , several bus come in , because the place be pack !you would walk past a room , and there would be a family of six staying in there .i do not know how anyone do that , with one bathroom .i do want to mention how my daughter be treat .as i mention earlier , they do not want to give I a towel card for she until i ask .at every meal , they would take we drink order , but never hers , and they would start to walk away and we would have to stop they to add she drink order to ours .at the nicer restaurant , she would not get a menu , etc. it be not like she be four , she be nine and still , they would just completely ignore she .i pay for she , just as i pay for we , she be not stay there free .again , not a huge deal , but something worth mentioning.the pool bar be where we spend the majority of we time .we meet a ton of great people .the first four or five day it be mostly american and canadian and we definately put a dent in they liqour inventory , lol .it be while talk to those people , that you learn where to go to eat , what excursion to go on or not , etc , because get info anywhere else be downright impossible .there be daily resort activity sheet print out , but never hand out and unless you go all the way upfront to the lobby , you never would know what be go on for the day .for example , rock climbing , which my daughter be so look forward to be only available twice a day at certain time for 15 minute , and we never make it .we arrive once in time , but the bottom of she shorts be wet from walk on the beach and she wasnt allow to go .they do have two employee walk around and take some great picture which be available in the lobby for $ 7 we later in the day .they also would have different animal to take pic with , such as a monkey one day , colorful parrot the next , beautiful white bird the next , so the kid all love that .reservation be a mess .i have read you have to make daily reservation at the restaurant .so the first morning hubbie and my father attempt to do this and just keep be tell to go somewhere else .no one talk to anyone else or know what to do outside of they little area .we end up make reservation that first night , but never need they from they on .but try to get this info be hard .for example , when we first arrive and unpacked and go exporing , i ask the pool bartender where the pool shack be .she literally have no idea and want to call housekeeping for we .now , i know that there be a building where you get you towel and then have to return they , but she have no idea .of course , it be right across from the pool , on the beach .when you ask where the bathroom be el bano ?you would just get a question look and it would be another guest that would tell you .ask where to make restaurant reservation , and one person would tell you you do not need reservation and another would tell you to go to the front desk , the front desk would tell you to go here , and then there , etc.it be those little thing that hubbie and i be talk about one night , sit outside on ` restaurant row ' have a drink .they label this resort as a 4.5 star .personally i would give it a 3.5 , but it would not take that much to make it a five star .they have everything in place .they have the pool , they have the swim up bar , they have the nice room , they have the spa , they have the activity , etc. but they have no communication .i dont want this to come out as i be a elitist or spoil but , they really need to have some of they employee be at least trilingual , spanish , english , maybe french , perhaps german .i dont know , its hard with this many people speak different language travel , but when the employee only speak spanish , it can make thing difficult .i have a rudimentary knowledge of spanish , but i can get by , not gracefully by any means , but i can get my thought across .and yes , i know that i be in a foreign country , yada yada , but as i mention i have travel extensively .i be not say that everyone , or even many or most of the employee need to speak english , but someone at the front desk should , and someone who answer the phone should .it be a joke that yes , there be indeed room service , but only if you speak spanish .i mention earlier that we have beer and wine in we room , but could not open they because we have no wine or bottle opener .i try call guest service to see if anyone could bring I one , and be transfer all over and be finally tell by someone that one would be bring right away .we be still wait , lol , and obviously buy we own from the gift shop .again , absolutely not a big deal but if you have a bottle of wine , perhaps just know where to get a bottle opener would be nice.all four adult have hour long massage on the beach with angela , for $ 55 each , and it be absolutely heaven on earth .she come around the pool area and be take reservation right then and there for the week .we each tip she ten buck and highly recommend it.hubbie and dad go on a deep sea fishing excursion .hubbie catch the first one .there be 7 guest on board and the boat come in with twelve mahus mahi 's and one other huge fish , so it be a huge success and they be both still rave about it .i will post pic when i can.we talk to the resort excursion people at the beach building about parasailing .we be tell $ 89 for twelve minute for two and no one could go and watch .i be down at the water edge when the ferry guy come up to pick people up for parasailing and he ask I if i want to go and i ask the price .we end up pay $ 70 for two people to go parasailing for 15 minute and three of we get to go and watch for free .so talk to the boat ferry people !we pay alot less for the exact same thing , same boat , same people.there be a marketplace right next to ob , which be awesome .talk to tony , three stall down and in the back , for great price on artwork .we bring three huge gorgeous peice home .dad bring two .i wonder who will get theirs hung first , lol.we do have to visit the medical building .my father have huge painful blister , and my step mom just want gauze and band aid for he .the doctor absolutely refuse and want to see he twice a day , every day for $ 50 each visit .she end up talk to guest service after go to the front desk and they order what she need from the pharmacy , have it deliver for $ 10 .there be a woman at the medical office while she be there who twist she ankle .they would ` nt let she get into the ambulance until she pay both the doctor 's bill and ambulance fee in advance -lrb- 250 we -rrb- .so , just as a precaution , bring bandaid , antiseptic , gauze just in case.the trip home be completely uneventful .i do want to mention however , that depart from punta cana be nothing like arrive .you would think you be at two completely different airport .arrive be all open air building and complete chaos .depart , be all organize line , air condition room , comfy chair , nice store and eat place , etc. night and day .we pay no depart tax , by the way , so i do not know what be up with that .you be tell by everyone to get there at least two hour in advance .there be no need for that , but do allow time for traffic or something.so in summary , we absolutely love this resort , we have very few problem or issue , and those we do have , we choose not to make they a big deal .yes , we safe would ' t open , but we get it fixx , yes we hear from other that thing in they room do not work , but all in all , i think it be great .would we go back ?probably not , but we rarely if ever go back to the same place twice .the water be pretty wavy for I .can i complain about that ?of course not .i much prefer calmer water like aruba , which of course be we ultimate favorite .will i recommend punta cana and ocean blue ?absolutely !i can not tell you how many people we talk to that go to punta cana every year , that be how beautiful it be .you can tell by all the construction this be go to be a huge travel destination in the very near future .so take advantage of the travel deal to be have .i hope you enjoy this honest review .if you have any question , feel free to contact I at

2,2,0,2,2,2,2,1,"beautiful grounds , friendly staff we find the ocean blue resort to be a good value .the grounds be meticulously clean and beautifully landscaped .the room be a bit worn and in need of update , but who stay in the room anyway ?when we arrive at we room , we find that one room have no light bulb , two room have safe that do not lock , and another room have water drip into the tub from the overhead light fixture and the telephone do not work .we call the registration desk about all of these issue , and they be resolve the follow morning by courteous staff .the morning , lunch and evening buffet be all good , especially the grilled lobster tail on christmas eve .we find the italian restaurant to be quite good and eat there twice , with salmon grilled to perfection .we spend most evening in the lobby bar area , which have a wonderful breeze 24/7 .the evening entertainment in the lobby be good , although we do tire of the caribbean music day after day .we be treat to some rock 'n roll music on christmas eve and have a blast with -lrb- almost -rrb- everyone in the bar dancing into the night .i read a review about the excursion be horrible .we enjoy the two excursion we book and feel that the price be well worth it .we go on the sanoa island excursion and love it .the speed boat ride there be cramped but we guide be a hoot and make the trip fun .the sanoa iisland beach be beautiful .lunch be serve just off the beach , and i be glad to see that it be serve in a sanitary manner -lrb- with no fly ! -rrb-.all member in we group think the bbq and side dish be quite good .the catamaran sail back to the mainland be great fun with music , dancing , beautiful water and beautiful scenery .i do not know how anyone could not like this excursion .we also book the zip line excursion .this be a brand new facility in the mountain that be nicely landscape .the zip line staff be friendly , thorough , and safe .be aware that one must climb up quite a few stair to the platform to access the zip line .if you can not do stair , this be not for you .the platform be very sturdy and well build .this be good , clean fun .i do not recall what the minimum age/size requirement be for child , but i be sure there be one .the ride to get to the zip line facility be a tour in and of itself .you be in a open air vehicle and be able to view the interesting plant life/flowers/cocoa tree , etc. as the vehicle slowly climb its way up the mountain to the zip line facility .i believe the safari tour take at least part of this route , so be aware of this if you be plan on do both the safari tour and the zip line as you may be see a lot of the same thing .if you be interested in a deep sea fishing excursion , you will probably want to check into this soon after you arrival .we wait until wednesday before inquire about this excursion and there be no availability .we usually prefer sit at the beach , but one or two day it be so windy at the beach that we retreat to the pool .the pool be large and clean .a few time we find it a challenge to find enough empty beach lounge to accommodate four people .some guest reserve they lounge in the morning by place towel on the lounge chair , and then you do not see anyone actually sit in the lounge for hour on end or even for the entire day .the staff be great about pick up empty glass etc. and keep the pool area tidy .overall , i be impressed most by the friendly and courteous staff .the local who work in the resort embrace the tourist -lrb- unlike jamaica -rrb- .please remember to tip the staff .yes , it be a all inclusive , but keep in mind that they wages be low and they cost of living be high .they work they you-know-what off to keep we in non-stop food , drink , and clean sheet ... and they provide it all with a sincere smile ."

1,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,"sweet staff , lot of little kid the lowdown : this place be huge .it be a little overwhelming , actually .there be a two or three shallow swimming pool -lrb- no deep end -rrb- and then a water park consist of three slide and a lazy river for a additional fee .to get to the beach , you need to wait for the ferry that will take you on a 10 minute ride to a private island that be own by the hotel .it be open from 9 to 5 and have one restaurant that serve bar food for lunch .to get to the ferry , you need to take a elevator down to a funicular ride , and hope you have time it so that the ferry be not just pull away as you get there .all of this mean that from slapping on you bikini to flop on you towel could take you a hour.the good : the staff be fantastically friendly .the food be pretty good .try the key lime pie , it be to die for , in fact , i order it via room service at midnight , and it arrive so promptly .the view be amazing !the water park be fun , and a neat addition .there be ton of activity to do on the premise -lrb- kayaking , snorkeling , scuba diving , ocean swimming , pool swimming , nightly movie , jet ski , banana boat , golf , tennis , etc. -rrb- and the front desk can hook you up with other tour nearby .the beach island have iguana , rabbit , tiny lizard and rooster .there be also a horse tour that look fun , although i do not go .the hiking be great , too , so if you be with people who lay around on the beach but you really want to get up and go , you can do both without have to separate all day long .that be pretty nice .the water be clean and clear , but there be sharp coral that bruise my foot .it be fun to collect though .i also find a conch in it be shell , and that be cool -lrb- be careful ; one of the local wander over as i be show a group of kid how cool we new friend be and talk about how she be go to use it when i be finish for soup .i set he free when she be not look , to the delight of the little kid who be sad when she talk about cook he and when she boyfriend talk about eat he raw . -rrb-my niece see a manatee -lrb- we be all still jealous we miss it -rrb- , and we whole family be greet by a humming bird flit around the bush we be sit by .the bad : even think the hotel be not crowd , service in the restaurant and on the hotel 's beach island be beyond slow .in the italian restaurant we wait over a hour before we appetizer arrive , and i watch other people leave in disgust after wait so long .we have a bad experience with we biolumninescent tour ; it be nearly a mile of kayacking and be nearly impossible for my 60 something mother in law and 9 year old nephew to keep up with , even though we be tell it be appropriate for all age .everyone in between -lrb- my husband and i , 26 , and 27 and he sibling and older niece and nephew -rrb- be just fine , as be all the other people in we group who be in the 16-50 range .this tour be book through the hotel for $ 90 per person , but if you just go to the dock where they leave from , you can book on the spot for around $ 45 .there be several company that offer tour of this really cool glow-in-the-dark bay , so if you be a small group , this be probably a good option .-lrb- go out the small white gate by where you catch the ferry , past the apartment , through a kind of sketchy area that just look abandon but be totally fine ; there be park car , and just walk a bit .you will stumble across several tourist snap into life vest get ready to go around 6 , 6:30 and later .def .check out those bioluminescent water .it be pretty awesome . -rrb-the worst for I be the hottub , which we nickname bubble tub because they be not hot at all .it be pretty disappointing .the water park be a extra charge , which be ridiculous consider what it be and what you be pay for everything else .it would be nice if it be free .there be plenty of room for adult to lounge pool side at the water park and there be a large shallow pool for the tiny kiddo , with a tiny kiddo waterslide , too .it would be great to get the family there and have the pool and hot tub consist of mostly adult .-lrb- we have a theory they keep the hot tub so cool to be kid-friendly -rrb- .the place be large which be cool , but i find this to be overwhelming and annoying , too .it be also overrun with little kid -lrb- the week between christmas and new year , though , mean little kid everywhere . -rrb-we be a group aged 9 - 65 -lrb- ten of we -rrb- , but i think we still would have prefer a older crowd ."

0,1,1,2,1,2,2,-1,"completely overrate - nyc , ny be very disappointed with this hotel , i basically book base on review here , which i have do in the past , but i find they off the mark this time .punta cana beach be beautiful easy to get to from nyc , so we will be back , but would not stay here again .we stay at the sol melia a few year back it be much nicer.overall , the place be show some serious wear tear .we get stick in the elevator one night , the landscaping be shoddy , the pool be look dingy / dirty around the edge , etc. the room be nice , although the couch in ours be disgust , i would not sit on it .the food be beyond terrible .i have eat at some bad buffet , but this be the worst i have ever see .the salad bar be tiny , and who want to eat hot pasta when it be 95 degree out ?the dominican restaurant be the best out of the lot , but not great .do not bother order wine -lrb- a la carte -rrb- , they must not keep it correctly because the 2 time we try it , it be terrible.the plus be that we always find a shady spot at the pool there be plenty of spot at the beach , which be really what matter to us.after walk down the beach check out other place -lrb- and stay at the sol melia in the past -rrb- , we know that there be much nicer spot in punta cana .do not waste you time on this one ."

but then again , it be call a hot tub .pool staff very polite and efficient .there be a wedding one afternoon and it be interesting to see how they slowly close down part of the patio to accommodate the wedding with minimal impact on the other guests.we have stay at the intercontinental -lrb- ic , for the purpose of this review -rrb- the last time we be in isle verde - and the ic be superior to the courtyard in every category .but then , the ic cost more .we expectation of the courtyard be high base on the ic , so some aspect be disappointing from the start.the best part of the hotel be the access to the beach - one of the reason we stay here .clean sand , nice wave , leave the pool and walk right onto the beach itself .kid love it .safe and fun .house-keeping be a bit slow , but they lose big point as we find a use condom on the bathroom floor when we first enter the room during we late check-in .yuck !!!!housekeeping resource be also just as strained during the visit as it be during the check-in .the first full day the room wasn鈥檛 clean until 17:00 .i speak with my friend at the check-in desk and they fix this .afterwards , the room be clean in the morning .i guess that you have to tell the hotel what you want instead of let they guess what you want.the hotel have several restaurant , but better value for money could be find outside .there be a breakfast buffet for $ 15.95 , but as a family of four , it would cost about $ 70 once the tax be apply .there be a ice cream counter that also have some baked item , but despite have three people behind the counter , you have to beat they with a stick to get they attention .in fairness to the hotel regard food price , all the other hotel on the beach also price gouge .they will charge as much as they think they can get you to pay .there be people in the restaurant , but many of they be short term visitor who go in without know what the damage would be .the price at the ic be much worse.as a breakfast alternative , there be a denny鈥檚 ten minute away across from the metropol -lrb- see below -rrb- .normal dennny鈥檚 food , but service be very , very slow .accept it and you will be happy .expect something snappy and you will get into a irritated funk .with the portion they serve , we brood of four only cost $ 20 .also a walgreen pharmacy in the same shopping area.speaking of price , we take it on the chin for the room charge .during christmas they -lrb- and all the other hotel -rrb- double the rate .so instead of around $ 180 a day , the room be $ 350 .it be still cheaper than the other hotel we consider .they also attach a 鈥渞esort fee鈥?of $ 45 -lrb- 13 % of the base price -rrb- a night .i be tell that cover free water in the room , towel service at the pool and entertainment at night .seem like a lot for daily water , one towel per person and loud music .it wasn鈥檛 a government require fee -lrb- like tourist tax -rrb- , but just a marriott policy .why charge a separate fee for no visible and severable cost unless you be try to hide a surcharge to make you rate look more attractive ?also a fee of $ 25 for each person in the room over two people per night .so in we case , another $ 50 per night .not a severable cost that they be try to recover .it be just a additional price that marriott charge .as they couldn鈥檛 associate a cost for the two extra people other than extra towel , i suppose the hotel grab what it can take .we know about the fee when we make the reservation by look closely at the marriott website , but many of my fellow traveler be surprise to see it on they bill .why hide these cost in the small print of the reservation ?put it up front in the rate .greed .and greed will find you by yourself and lonely one day marriott at isle verde.the hotel over charge we on the final bill in that one of we brood be 12 and exempt to the $ 25 extra person fee and they apply the 13 % resort fee to the extra person fee also .we chat about it for some time and they finally eliminate the resort fee , but keep the extra person fees.as we be now on food , the location of hotel be a little inconvenient as it be on the end of the develop beach .all the non-hotel restaurant be a short walk away along a busy road -lrb- busy with car , but sometimes a little uneasily devoid of people - especially at night - until you reach the metropol -rrb- .lot of 鈥渇amily鈥?style or fast food place 15 minute away on the main rood -lrb- across from the ic -rrb- .as well as the mi casita in a small strip mall across from the ic - good local fare at very reasonable price .basic atmosphere , but always pack .the bill at mi casita double charge the drink one night , so buyer beware .also a chinese place a few door down from mi casita .normally not very full , but tasty .not great , but tasty.best non-hotel restaurant remain the metropol - local food , fairly price , big portion , nice atmosphere .between the hotel and the ic and next to the cock-fighting arena -lrb- wonder if the lose bird be serve at the restaurant next door ? -rrb-.we go there almost everyday .the kid love the grilled red snapper .i like the pepper steak cuban style and stuff guinea fowl .service could have be better , but it depend if you have the a team or the b team for waiter .also , the wife report that there wasn鈥檛 any run water in the lady room for three day -lrb- include flush -rrb- .so 鈥渇reshen up鈥?before you go just in case and avoid a seat -lrb- at a table -rrb- near the toilet .she report it each time , but what the heck -

when we bring it to they attention , the waitress and 鈥渕anager鈥?assured we that the food be fine , and we have just order something that we didn鈥檛 like -lrb- grilled snapper or grouper and a traditional mexican combo plate -rrb- .such a disappointment .it look like the menu have change somewhat since last time , but after we first experience , why throw money away .anything that bad doesn鈥檛 deserve a second chance .have say that , we do dip we toe in the water and try the lupi鈥檚 nacho during a beering session .i think they be so-so , but the wife think they be the worst she鈥檚 have .guacamole be describe as slimey and the beef suspicious .she couldn鈥檛 eat it .that be yesterday and i don鈥檛 feel sick , so i suppose it be ok to eat it .the pool guy at the hotel also think that the food be bad - with the exception of the buffalo wing .look fantastic from the outside as a mexican sport bar - you mouth will water , but such a disappointment .it鈥檚 hard to mess up mexican food -lrb- even taco bell express and old el paso at the supermarket get by -rrb- , but they find the secret -lrb- its even worse than mine -rrb- .one thing we didn鈥檛 like -lrb- not relate to the hotel -rrb- , be the absence of small grocery store .7-11鈥榮 , etc. to stock the fridge in the room there be one across from the ic of good size , but the shelf be only one third full .strange place .there be also a pueblo market on the other side of the holiday inn , but not very easy to get to.would i go back again ?if my first choice be too expensive or full , i think that i would .but i would watch the bill like a hawk and let they know ahead of time that check-in be at 15:00 and room be to be clean in the morning .after all , the beach be great and the people try hard to make it a nice stay -lrb- once you check in -rrb- ."

the w hotel stay be for any friday or saturday night .at first i think it be a mix-up by the charity , and frankly , it be for charity and i do not really care .but after my experience with the arrogant , sloppy and just horrifically bad service at the w , i now wonder if the mistake be theirs.when i realize the room and ticket be incompatible , i decide to use the room as a surprise for the bf .i procure theatre ticket to a sell out show , and call the w to make a reservation .after be on hold for at least 10 minute while the operator try to figure it out , i be send to the 800 number .the 800 operator be not exactly rude , but disinterested , uninformed , and generally ooze negative attitude .she , too , could not figure it out , and it literally take over 1/2 hour to make the reservation.when i make the reservation , i also tell the operator that i want a corner room with a view and would pay whatever it take to upgrade to it .she assure I that i would have a corner room on a high floor with a view , and even after i offer three time to pay for a upgrade , she tell I -lrb- coldly and condescendingly -lrb- difficult to articulate -rrb- -rrb- that it would not be necessary and that i would get my request.you can see where this be go .when we arrive for check in , they give we a corner room on the 5th floor in the back of the building , face the wall of the four season 's garage across a alley .when i speak to the disinterested i be too cool for my job desk clerk , the best i could get be a regular room on a somewhat higher floor , also in the back of the building , this time overlook the same garage by about 10 foot .no apology , no real help , and attitude .by the way -- when i present the ` bearer certificate ' that i discuss with the reservation department for over 30 minute earlier in the day , mr. hip have no idea what to do , call over a apparently more experienced version of himself , and the two of they take 20 minute to , you guess it , figure it out.trying to keep a positive outlook , the bf and i decide to go to earth and ocean , the hotel restaurant .it be a busy saturday night .we stand in a highly trafficked area and be ignore until i be able to stop the greeter , who tell I they be no longer serve in the dining room , but we could order from a bar menu at the bar .then he walk away .i mean , literally -- just walk away without additional comment , leave we to figure out if we should seat ourselves , wait for someone else , or move into the lounge area .after a moment , we be able to stop another staff member who hand we two sticky bar menu while we be still stand in that odd , highly trafficked area , and i swear -- he , too , just walk away without comment .we leave and go to a bistro down the street.the room be okay , albeit dark and face the roof deck of the garage across the alley ; the bathroom be dirty and well below five star standards.we leave the next morning , and the portfolio read zero balance .while i be very disappointed with the attitude and service of the staff from begin to end , think the room be substandard , and have pay several hundred dollar for a package that be not a package , i think i would just let it go and remember that at least the charity make out well.then , of course , i get my credit card bill .yep , you guess it .they charge I for the privilege of be ignore , condescend to , spending -lrb- between the two operator -rrb- over forty-five minute to even make a reservation , and place I in a substandard room with a dirty bathroom .i call they to correct the latest mistake in a series of mistake , and after explain the situation to someone in they reservation department , be forward to the guest service manager .i can not articulate the attitude well at all -- but at least it be consistent .disinterested and arrogant be the best way to describe it .he tell I that he would look into it , and call I back .two day later i get a voicemail from he ask for the charity i purchase the room from , because he could not find the certificate .at this point , i be furious and do not immediately return the call .about a hour later , he call again and tell I he find the certificate and would be refund the $ 230.00 charge to my card .the entire conversation take less than 30 seconds , and end with a curt , perfunctory and insincere apology .period.wow ... just unbelievable .i do not see why anyone would want to stay here .the room be average at best , the bathroom be dirty , and the service be just too hip and arrogant to be anything but worthless .the location be good , poise strategically between the financial and retail district downtown , but so be several other very fine hotel .if you come to seattle , stay in the area , but do not stay at this facility .i can not imagine anyplace that would reflect more poorly on we city ."

we find it to be a good thing .the suite be on the outside of the chevron , mean that we face toward the ocean , away from the property .this be a big advantage because it be much quieter , although there be a service road for employee run along the side.while we be there , they be do a lot of masonry work , which will definitely improve the appearance of the place , but be a bit inconvenient for we .there be a lovely pool that meander through the facility .you can not swim from one end to the other because there be a dam of sort in the middle - i never find out why .the pool be all tile , uniformly 3 foot deep , and immaculate .there be plenty of lounge chair , both along the pool and on the beach .the beach be beautiful , with soft sand .i find it well maintain from end to end , and be surprise that there be review that call it rocky .perhaps as part of the transition they repair this.there be plenty of activity during the day , although they be not always well organize .there be the explorer 's club , a kind of day camp/day care center for kid , and separate activity for teens .at night there be always show in the theater at 9:30 pm , usually with loud recorded music and choreograph dancing , less frequently with live music .there be a postage stamp size casino .the dealer tend to the amateurish , but be as likely to make a mistake in you favor as one against you.our honeymoon suite consist of two room .you walk into a living area with a couch , loveseat , coffee table , and armoire with a tv .there be a large -lrb- not walk-in -rrb- closet with a iron and iron board stow .there be a mini-bar area that be stock with beer , coke , diet coke , and sprite as well as bottled water .the bottled water be a local brand which have a bit of a chlorine taste that disappear as you get use to it .it would not sell very well in the we , but it be literally eau de vie here , where the tap water be contaminate and unsafe.the bedroom , which be similar to other room we see , have a king-size canopy bed .the mattress be very firm .there be no cover for the canopy so the ceiling fan could do its thing -lrb- there be also a fan in the living room -rrb- .there be another armoire with another tv .the tv channel be plentiful and include all we network , but the network outlet be , inexplicably , denver .the bedroom open to the dress area which contain two sink , plenty of amenity -lrb- soap , shampoo , toothbrush , shaving , etc -rrb- .the dress area have a large walk-in closet on one side -lrb- if you can not find a home for you stuff here , you bring too much -rrb- .the other side of the dress room have a door to the lavatory which consist of a commode and a walk-in shower .this be a european style shower , with a transitional space outside the water flow .the pressure be excellent , and the shower be a hand-held one that be mount on a adjustable rod .the living room have a slide door that open to a veranda .i would say we veranda be over 20 foot long .the regular veranda be about half that .the veranda have a plastic table and two plastic chair .there be a large jacuzzi on the far end .we use this a lot and it be great .it only take about 20 minute to fill.in general , the room be lovely but there be minor issue , like a rusty closet rod , chip paint , and a couple of warped ceiling tile that prevent this place from be a 5-star facility .maybe the transition include plan repair that will improve it.now for the food .the default be the world cafe , a huge buffet with a wide variety of food .there be a italian place within the world cafe , kind of a pizza and pasta place .also in the main building be himatsu , part teppenyakus , part chinese , and the patio , a mexican restaurant adjacent to the world cafe.in another building by the ocean , there be 3 restaurant .on the second floor be bordeaux -lrb- formerly dream -rrb- , a adults-only continental style restaurant .on the ground level be oceana , with a seafood emphasis and the seaside grill , with a meat emphasis .none of the prepared food be particularly good .some of it be ok ; a lot be overcooked and/or oversauced .seafood and shrimp in particular , seem to get better treatment than meat and fowl .the chinese food be actually bizarre and make I pine for la choy !there be no actual asian employee -lrb- that i could see -rrb- in the asian restaurant .on the upside , the fruit be wonderful , some of the seafood dish be quite good , and there be plenty to eat .only the world be open for 3 meal .the seaside grill be also open for lunch .there be a daily lunch barbeque on the beach , and all the other be dinner only.we be unlikely to return to this place , mainly because of the hassle of travel here from the southwestern we , but the weather and the service be wonderful , and it be a really lovely place .because of the spread-out nature , plus a lack of elevator , i would not recommend it to anybody with major physical disability , although they do accommodate such ."

egg , bacon -lrb- if cook well that day -rrb- , and pork be only good tasting item other than french fries .i be not a health nut and will eat most anything and none of we have a good meal twice.drinks-if you a beer drinker you s-o-l .the dominican have three different kind of beer , el presedente , bohemia especial , and quisqueya .quisqueya be the only one that taste terrible and that the only one th riu property carry .all in we party be beer drinker with various taste in beer and be very dissapointed .i decide that since i spend almost 2 g 's for my wife and i to go i would not hesitate to spend $ 60 a case in the gift shop for bud , bud light and corrona .get costly but i do not care.bad move on my part to walk around drink out of the bottle.after numerous people find out where i get they they sell out quickly as each gift shop in the riu family only stock about a twelve pack of each .room - very basic 2 star in u.s.a. grounds be well kept.bottom line for we be we could not wait to get back to the state and all eat at mcdonald as we wait for out connect flight in atlanta .i go with the mindset that even if the food be so-so i just want to lay on the beach and drink a few beer for 5 or 6 day .for these people who say the food be excellent and the room be 5 star i would like to sell you some swamp land in florida .unless i eat only fruit or come from a third world country would i say the food be great .i have doubt and do not believe many of the review i read such as this but you will find i be tell the truth .so here be some tip to help you out when you realize what i do .# 1 when you want to get a good beer or even a case take a taxi to the mall where hard rock cafe be located and get a good meal while you down there .only cost about $ 10 for the taxi and they have good food and all different brand of beer .not cheap beer or food but good .save the book they hand you about punta cana as you walk into the airport upon arrival .read it and use it to point out to the taxi driver where you want to go .# 2 bring a soft cooler and insulate mug to bring you beverage down to the beach .no service down there and long walk to keep fill up 10 o.z. glass they give you at bar .# 3 if you be a soda drinker do not expect the 7 up and pepsi they give you in the room for free to taste like back home because they do not .buy some coke or gatorade when you make you beer run .and i like pepsi not coke .# 4 go to costco and pick up a 30 pack of snack and pack they away .even if you go off site the price for these item be ridiculous .# 5 if you like to read then bring enough material for the whole trip as you can not find a u.s. newspaper anywhere in the riu .they have some popular u.s. magazine with date from a month ago on them.finally and probably the most important tip i would give be to not book at this resort complex .maybe in a few year when they get the food and drink issue resolve .i have find , maybe contrary to other that all inclusive be not the way to go in the dominican .food not good/drinks be water down very badly/and beer and liquer serve be very low quality which be probably why we do not see many drunk people .talk to many other people who where stay at non-all inclusive resort and they indicate you could get any beverage you want and food be very good.if you have any other question feel free to e-mail I and i will give a honest answer as i do not want anyone to go through what we do if they can avoid it .by the time we figure everything out it be time to go home.sincerely , chrisharrison township , michigan u.s.a.burden1@wowway.com"

explain the situation and apologize although he didn鈥檛 do it .but again they be talk in spanish first and then to I in english -- so who know !!!!recommendation for african american : it鈥檚 a nice place to visit .the resort be nice consider all of the above comment .if you don鈥檛 like the hot sun and a lot of water sport -- then it鈥檚 not the place to offer other activity to keep you busy .we go to the pool and beach at least 4 day but the heat be get to we .the activity be around the main pool where it鈥檚 very hot .i be look forward to some of the activity but again it take I a while to find
