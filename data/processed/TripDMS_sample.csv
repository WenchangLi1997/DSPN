1,1,0,2,2,2,2,2,"good hotel in nice location with thin wall .my wife and i just return from a trip to italy .we stay in this hotel for two nights.we book this hotel for the good review in tripavisor and in general it be what we expected.the hotel be located in a nice and quiet district away from the expensive and crowded area , just a few minute walk from the train station .the room be beautifully decorate clean and spacious , breakfast in bed be good .the staff be friendly and helpful.this hotel have , in my opinion , a major thin wall problem , we could actually hear the conversation in the next room .surprisingly no one mention it before .may be we just get the one bad room ."

0,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,"disappointing ... .i be disapoint at several things.this hotel have a great location but lot of buts.firstly , it be hugely overprice for what you get .i have a deluxe double room on the 6th floor .it be tiny .there be minimal space to walk around the bed .there be no tea/coffee make facilitis in the room .the shower be nice , but no bath and frankly i would have love a relaxing bath.the hotel have a roof top bar which have a private party while i be there and consequently unavailable to the guest , and the noise be just awful.there be no breakfast include in the room tariff , and breakfast be 30 euro per person on the menu card.concierge be less than helpfull .before my trip i email the hotel to ask if they pick up they guest , i be tell yes , but not tell that this be at a extortionate rate .on the last day , i discover the charge be 113 euro !!!!!!!!!a taxi on the way back be 38 euros.i would not return , and would recommend stay elsewhere.conclusion - great location , overprice , unhelpful staff ."
1,1,2,-1,2,-1,0,-1,"very good hotel bbut stay at the hotel for 5 night in feb 2005 .very stylish although small and very clean .room good but again very small .a way out of town and right on the sea front so quiet .nearest metro station about ten min walk and taxi back to hotel from centre of town about 10 euro .make sure you know where hotel be as no taxi driver seem to know !!!all in all a good stay and reasonable value for money .not quite sure how it get a 4 * rating.butrestauarant apalling , no atmosphere , staff lack in attention to detail and level of service .food available past 10 be for breakfast virtually choiceless , particularly at weekend , even though serve -lrb- sorry available -rrb- till 10.30 .-lrb- get down early -rrb- .very impersonal ambience in a evening.only two english -lrb- both news -rrb- channel available on satellite tv ."
0,0,1,2,1,2,2,0,"mixed review i stay at the hyatt for a conference .the conference rate offer to the attendee be the same as the regular rate post on the hotel website , which i find a little odd .the hotel be in a great location , convenient to bart and right on the embarcadero .the ferry building -lrb- across the street -rrb- be a fantastic place with wonderful restaurant and shop - we eat there several time during the conference .we also be lucky to have wonderful weather , and it be great to be able to stroll out of the hotel for a nice walk along the bay.the hotel be nice , but not outstanding .my room have a bay view -lrb- i pay for the upgrade -rrb- and a balcony , which be nice - beautiful morning view of the pier .the weird thing be , if you sit on the -lrb- very comfortable -rrb- balcony furniture , you can not see anything because the concrete railing be tall and thick .the room , as note in other review , be nice , but kind of basic .very nice bed and bedding , and very comfy desk chair , but the bathroom be kind of vintage , and the lighting over the bathroom sink be pretty bad .my room also have stud on the wall where apparently a frame picture once be ; give the room a half-finished look .the temperature control in the room be inefficient ; there be one vent near the ceiling that push air in the general direction of the tv ; take a while to cool or warm the room , which be a problem as the large balcony door/window mean it be a bit drafty .also , in my bathtub , the shower faucet be loose enough that it would not stay put at the choose temperature ; the handle would just slowly sink until the water be scalding .i solve it by wedge a cardboard coffee cup sleeve -lrb- from the coffee service -rrb- between the handle and the rest of the fixture to stop the thing from slide down , but sheesh.i do not eat in the hotel , as there be so many other -lrb- less-expensive -rrb- option in the area .you have to pay $ 10 daily for internet , which always annoy I in hotel , especially those with rate like the hyatt 's .housekeeping also be very late the first day i be there -lrb- i.e. , return to a still un-cleaned room at 4:30 pm -rrb- .it be subsequently clean earlier -lrb- not sure if that have to do with the fact that i leave a daily tip with a thank you note -rrb- .housekeeping staff i pass in the hallway be unfailingly friendly and courteous.i can not recommend the hyatt for people who be expect true 4 or 5 star accommodation , although the location be great and the staff be good ."

-rrb-.so we return to the 2nd building and get all we luggage together and drag it all back to the main building and find we new room .we new dark room !we be look straight out at a brick wall and still no king size bed as requested!back to the reception desk again where we speak with the most venomous woman i have have the displeasure of deal with !we explain that we be unhappy with the room we have be give and want a new room .to this we be patronise and speak down to .she say that we should never have be move to the main building as it be not policy to have virgin holiday customer in the main building ~ they be all put up in the 2nd building .we explain that we do not want to stay in the 2nd building and would prefer the main building .we also explain that we have previously book with virgin and have always stay in the main building .this woman then make out that we be lie and say there be nothing much that she could do .bear in mind that while all this be go on she be wear a badge that say ` it be all about you ' !!what a joke.after some time she start look at room mutter ` if you be n'thappy with that then you will not be happy with this one ' .in less that 10 minute this woman have get to know we so well that she know what I and my husband would like !she try to move we back to we original room -lrb- the one overlook the dumpster -rrb- to which we refuse and she finally find we a room in the main building .again we have to move you own luggage to a room that be one floor higher than we previous room and overlook the same brick wall!at this point we be exhaust from we transatlantic flight and theluggage move we have be do !we decide to settle as it appear that holiday inn fisherman 's wharf be no longer ` all about you !` after the worst night sleep ever -lrb- the room be over the garbage andservice entry on the main building -rrb- we decide to try the reception desk one last try to see if any room have become vacant during the morning.we speak to a fantastic lady -lrb- remi -rrb- who be very sympathetic to ourneed and search out a room for we .she find one which be stillbee clean but put a rush on it for we .everything that the previous day staff say be not possible be suddenly very possible !we be in we new room within the hour !remi also offer to have we luggage move for we ~ something that we have not be offer before either!our new room be great ~ remus have upgrade we to the 5th floor -lrb- the only real difference in the actual room be you get a microwave -rrb- .but we be high enough up not to hear any of the service lorry noise and we actually have a view of the city!we go along to we ` virgin holiday rep ' meeting and speak with other holiday traveller there .and what a surprise , most of these be in the main building .so this so call policy of put virgin customer in the 2nd building seem a bit suspect to me.our stay be fantastic after remus sort thing out for we .we nearly cancel we stay and move across the street due to the previous night farce at reception!if you be a virgin holiday customer , and be stay for 4night ormore , make sure you attend the welcome meeting and get you free baycruise -lrb- worth $ 21 dollar each -rrb- .the virgin rep do not like to give these out unless he be pressed!would i stay here again - no !one bad experience at check in have ruin 5 year good work by this hotel !"
