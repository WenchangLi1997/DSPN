# DSPN

Distantly supervised pyramid network for ACSA


This package includes code for implementing the models and experiments described in the EMNLP 2022 submission: "A Joint Pyramid Network for Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis with Distant Supervision."

In particular, **models.py** defines the DSPN model and the baseline models used in our experiments, and **DSPN.py** provides the code for training the DSPN models.
